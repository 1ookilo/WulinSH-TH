R10005-10_1_4,It seems that you worship the God of Jiuli to gain blessings in battle or power.,,看来你们祭祀九黎之神肯定是为了获得战斗或力量方面的赐福吧。
R10005-10_1_5,"It's roughly like that, but there's also a saying in our tribe: if a man and woman love each other, they can go to the altar to receive the blessing of the God of Jiuli, and the couple will stay together for life, growing old together.",,差不多是这样的，不过在我们部落里还流传这样一个说法：部落里的男女若是相亲相爱，可到祭坛接受九黎之神的赐福，男女双方就会相守一生，白头偕老。

R10035-2-1_2_3,"I expected this, fortunately, I came prepared.",,早料到会如此，幸好本公子早有准备。
R10035-2-1_2_4,(Handing over an item),,（递过一件东西）
R10035-2-1_2_5,"This is, this is the imperial edict?",,这是，这是圣旨？

R10035-2-1_2_8,"This is absolutely absurd, the head teacher will not agree!",,简直荒唐至极，掌教不会同意的！
R10035-2-1_2_9,The head teacher will weigh the pros and cons. This is an imperial edict. He must be aware of the consequences of resisting the edict. I don't think he would want the centuries-old inheritance to end in his generation.,,掌教真人会权衡利弊的，这可是圣旨，他肯定清楚抗旨的后果，真人想必不会希望百年传承断送在他这一代吧。
R10035-2-1_2_10,"However, there is still room for negotiation in this matter...",,不过，这事情也还有商量的余地……
R10035-2-1_2_11,"As long as you let me learn the Zhenwu Sword Formation, the matter of using the sect's manual to offset the tribute can be avoided.",,只要你让本公子领教了真武剑阵，这镇派秘籍抵扣岁币的事情就可免了。
R10035-2-1_2_12,"This is an imperial edict, how can it be avoided as you say?",,这可是圣旨，怎么可能由着你说免就免。
R10035-2-1_2_13,"As a special envoy of Yan and a member of the Yan royal family, such a small matter is easy for me.",,本公子既是燕国特使，又是燕国皇族，这等小事还不是轻而易举。
R10035-2-1_2_14,"You, you, you!",,你，你，你！
R10035-2-1_2_15,"If you don't agree, I will have to find the head teacher and ask him to make a sacrifice.",,你若不肯，我只有去找掌教真人，请他老人家割爱了。
R10035-2-1_2_16,"Fine, I agree!
However, the power of the Zhenwu Sword Formation is great. We each take our own risks!",,"好，我答应你！
不过，这真武剑阵威力奇大，生死各安天命！"
R10035-2-1_2_17,"{PlayerGivenName}, it's rare to see the Zhenwu Sword Formation. How about breaking the formation with me?",,{PlayerGivenName}兄，难得见识这真武剑阵，随我一同破阵如何？

R10035-2-1_3_3,The Zhenwu Sword Formation is indeed well-deserved. I have learned a lot today. Goodbye!,,真武剑阵果然名不虚传，本公子今日领教了，告辞！
R10035-2-1_3_4,"In this troubled world, even the Taoist Sect is not spared...",,多事之秋，道玄宗也不能幸免……

曾不惜假冒仆役混进妙音坊，偷偷抄录其中珍藏的绝世曲谱。"

R10061-1_5_6,"Afterwards, they realized that I had left without saying goodbye, and they concluded that I was the arsonist. They also insisted that I had stolen their sect's music score, so they sent disciples to chase me relentlessly.",,事后她们发觉我不辞而别，便认定我是那纵火之人，还一口咬定我盗走了她们的镇派曲谱，于是派弟子对我穷追不舍。
R10061-1_5_7,"A few days ago, I knew they would chase me to the vicinity of Chuxiang City, so I deliberately annoyed the Official and got myself locked up in this Prison, hoping to avoid them.",,早几日我知道她们必定会追到这楚襄城附近，于是借故惹恼官差让他把我关到这牢房中，本希望可以躲过一劫。
R10061-1_5_8,"I didn't expect the women of Melody House to be so powerful. If it weren't for {PlayerSurName} brother's help, I would have been taken back to Melody House and skinned alive.",,真没想到妙音坊的婆娘果然神通广大，要不是{PlayerSurName}兄出手相助，恐怕我就要被她们带回妙音坊扒皮抽筋了。

凡是她们认定之事，任你如何费尽唇舌也不会有丝毫改变。"
R10061-1_5_11,"The disciples of Melody House will only obey orders to catch me and bring me back, they won't listen to my explanations; besides, I did have ulterior motives for sneaking into Melody House, so I can't prove my innocence.",,妙音坊弟子只会服从命令坚持捉我回去，怎可能听我解释；更何况，我潜入妙音坊确实另有所图，所以无法自证清白。
R10061-1_5_12,"So what are you going to do now, continue to hide?",,那么你今后如何打算，继续东躲西藏吗？
R10061-1_5_13,"Melody House is extremely arrogant, they once claimed that if anyone could evade their pursuit three times, they would let bygones be bygones. {PlayerSurName} brother just helped me evade their pursuit for the third time, so my grudge with Melody House is settled.",,妙音坊自负无比，曾声称如果有人能躲过她们三次追杀就既往不咎，{PlayerSurName}兄刚好帮我躲过了第三次追杀，从此我跟妙音坊恩怨一笔勾销了。

Main10099-1_15_2,"Don't be surprised, the sect's name is just a code, it has no practical significance. After thousands of years, any sect will gradually decline and perish. Instead of caring about the sect's name, it's better to live in the present and stand out.",,别大惊小怪的，门派名称只是一个代号，没什么实际意义。千百年之后，任何门派都会逐渐没落衰亡，于其计较门派名字，不如活在当下，出人头地。

Many of them are forced into banditry by the government.",,刚灭了一伙不成气候的山贼就不知道天高地厚了？且不说山外有山人外有人，这世上山贼土匪也不全是坏人，有不少是受官府逼迫，不得已落草的。

Then you will gradually understand how to distinguish.",,读万卷书不如行万里路，咱们江湖人也是如此，不能一味只会追求武道修为，还需要多到各地游历，体会民间疾苦，这样你自己就逐渐懂得分辨了。

R10099-2_5_1,"I forgot to tell you, it will take some time for the Coachman to arrive. In the meantime, you can go to the Lost Forest to practice your skills, so you'll be prepared for the future.",,忘记跟你说了，车夫要过些时候才能赶来，趁这时候可以去迷踪林锻炼下自己身手，将来有备无患。

R10099-3_2_5,"(So Master's real name is Yan Gexing, why didn't he tell me before?)",,（师父名讳原来叫燕歌行，为什么之前不告诉我呢？）
R10099-3_2_6,What brings you to me?,,你来找本将军做什么？

In the past, you and your brothers were invincible when you joined forces, but now, hehe...",,燕歌行，今时不同往日，江湖上谁不知你武功尽失，经脉尽毁。以前你们师兄弟联手天下无敌，现如今，嘿嘿……
