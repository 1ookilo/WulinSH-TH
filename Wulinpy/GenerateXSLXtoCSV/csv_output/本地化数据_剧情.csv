3019_1_6,"That thing looks like it's made of gold, but it's actually copper. The landlady said the inn is short of a copper incense burner, so if I can't pay off my debt, it's just right to use it as collateral. She plans to melt it down as material for the incense burner.",,那个东西看起来好像是黄金打造，其实是个铜的。老板娘说店里缺个铜制的香炉，要是还不上钱就正好拿它抵债，她准备把这东西给融了当香炉的材料。

Not only do the ancients disagree with what these heroes do, but the court has also issued a <color=#c44b0e>prohibition on martial arts</color>.",,年轻人学什么不好，非要去学那些徒有蛮力的闲汉去当“大侠”。先贤曾留名言警句：侠以武犯禁！不但先贤们不认同这些大侠的所作所为，就连朝廷也颁布了<color=#c44b0e>止武诏</color>。
3025_1_2,"The so-called prohibition on martial arts is that non-officials should stop using weapons. Presumably, these law-breaking heroes have touched the bottom line of the court, hence this decisive action.",,所谓止武诏，便是非官之身，非官之身，息戈止武。想必这些犯禁的大侠们已经触及了朝廷的底线，因此会招来这釜底抽薪之举。
3025_1_3,"{PlayerSurName}Young man, in your prime, heed an old man's advice. Go home and study for a few more years, so you can serve the court in the future. Learning those sword and spear moves, if caught by the court, your life could be ruined.",,{PlayerSurName}小哥你这大好年华，听老夫一句劝，早些回家多读几年书，将来也好报效朝廷。学那些舞刀弄枪的把式，说不好被朝廷抓到，小命可就断送了。

These farming tools can't be separated from iron.",,朝廷里那些闲的蛋疼的官老爷，怕老百姓私造兵器造反，鼓捣什么<color=#c44b0e>禁铁令</color>。不让我们动用铁器，地里的农活怎么办，这些农具可都离不开铁器。
3026_1_2,"If the common people have a place to live and food to eat, who would risk their lives to rebel? It's because they are forced to have no place to live and no food to eat, rather than waiting to die, they rebel to seek a way out.",,老百姓要是有地方住，有饭吃，谁会豁出命来去造反？还不是被逼的没地方住没饭吃，于其等死不如造反博一条出路。
3026_1_3,"In my opinion, this Iron Prohibition Order will not only fail to stop the momentum of rebellion, but will force more people to take risks. Fortunately, our Nameless village is located in a remote area, and those officials disdain to come to our poor mountain village to make a profit, so we are barely surviving in this chaotic world.",,我看啊，这禁铁令非但不会止了造反的势头，只会逼得更多人铤而走险。好在咱们无名小村地处偏僻，那些官老爷也不屑到咱们这穷山村里捞油水，我们这才在乱世中苟活着。

With this Wooden sword you gave him, all my years of persuasion have been wasted.",,你明知道老夫最反感舞刀弄枪的事情，我这孙儿本来就天天想着有朝一日学那些大侠的模样仗剑走天涯。你这把木剑一送出，老夫这几年苦口婆心地劝导白费了。
3027_1_4,What sin have I committed...,,我这是造了什么孽啊…..

Z004_14_2,"The matter here is settled, we will meet again if fate allows!",,此间事已了，以后有缘自会再会！

Z005_2_1,"Well answered! Now for the second question, who are the four Honorable in the flowers:",,答得好！且听第二题，花中四君子是：
Z005_3_1,"Young hero, you are indeed knowledgeable! The last question, who is not among the mythical Eight Immortals:",,少侠果然学识渊博！最后一题，何人不属于神话八仙之列：
Z005_4_1,"You got this question wrong, young hero. Come back another day!",,此题错矣，少侠改日再来吧！
Z005_5_1,"Young hero, you've missed your chance today. Come back another day and make sure to answer all the questions correctly to meet the master.",,少侠今日已错失良机，改日再来，务必全题答对方能见到师尊。
Z005_6_1,"You've answered all three questions correctly, young hero. From now on, you are a distinguished guest of our Linlang Academy.",,三题已经全部答对无误，少侠从现在起就是我们琳琅书院的贵客了。
Z005_6_10,"Alas, even I find this reason unconvincing.",,唉，这个理由我自己都认为不靠谱。
Z005_6_11,"However, the person who stole the sword mentioned your name. Even if it's a frame-up, it's likely someone who has a grudge against you. So, both emotionally and rationally, you should help find this thief.",,不过盗剑之人提到了你的名字，就算是栽赃嫁祸，多半也是与你有瓜葛之人。所以于情于理你都该出面一同找到这盗剑之人。
Z005_6_12,If I were to say who has a grudge against Linlang Academy recently... it would be the <color=#c44b0e>Confucius Temple</color> in the north. You could go there and investigate.,,近日如我或说是与琳琅书院有嫌隙的势力……那便只有北方的<color=#c44b0e>儒圣馆</color>了。你可去那里一探究竟。

Z005_6_14,"You better explain the whole story to me, so I can justify my actions.",,你还是把这前因后果给我交代清楚吧，也好叫我师出有名。
Z005_6_15,"This is a long story, let me make it short. Our Linlang Academy has a secret technique that combines the Mohist and Luban schools, which can create Machinery puppets with great Power.",,此事说来话长，我还是跟你长话短说吧。我这琳琅书院有一门墨家和鲁班门相结合的秘术，可以打造威力巨大的机关人偶。
Z005_6_16,"Some people with ulterior motives, like those from the Confucius Temple, forced us to hand over the secret technique. They even dared to make enemies with various martial arts factions in my name, aiming to isolate our Linlang Academy.",,一些别有用心之人，比如儒圣馆之流逼迫我等交出秘术，不惜冒我之名与武林各派为敌，目的是为了使我们琳琅书院陷入孤立无援之地。
Z005_6_17,"If it weren't for these puppets protecting the academy, this place would have been razed to the ground by them. So, this despicable act of stealing the sword in my name, besides the Confucius Temple, no one else would think of it.",,若不是这些人偶护着书院周全，这里早就被那伙人夷为平地了。所以这次冒名盗剑的猥琐之事，除了儒圣馆那群斯文败类，不做第二人想。
Z005_6_18,"Alright, I'll go reason with them! However, I'm currently outnumbered. I don't mind that you're disabled, you must have some secret skills. If we join forces, we can definitely defeat them!",,好，我去找他们说理！不过，我现在双拳难敌四手，我可不嫌弃你是残疾人，你肯定有啥秘传绝学傍身，咱俩联手肯定会打的他们落花流水！
Z005_6_19,"I left a token in the Nameless village years ago. If you can find it, I'll help you this time.",,我早年在无名小村留下一枚信物，你若能找到，我便帮你走这一遭。
Z005_6_2,"There is someone waiting for you inside, young hero. You can go in by yourself.",,里面有人在恭候少侠，少侠可自行入内。
Z005_6_20,Is there any clue about that token?,,那信物可有什么线索吗?
Z005_6_21,"If you're popular in the Nameless village, the Village Head will surely give you a surprise.",,假如你在无名小村人缘不错的话，那个村长想必会给你惊喜的。
Z005_6_3,"(This young man in the wheelchair with white hair, his face pale and spirit worn, but his eyes are very wise. I wonder which expert of the Linlang Academy he is. It's a pity that he's disabled at such a young age.)",,（这轮椅上白发年轻人，面色泛白精神憔悴，但是眼神却十分睿智，不知是琳琅书院的哪一位高人。年纪轻轻落下残疾，真是可惜啊。）
Z005_6_4,"Hey, it's quite impolite to look at someone with such a pitying gaze when you first meet.",,喂，初次见面就用这么悲天悯人的眼神看着别人，似乎很不礼貌。
Z005_6_5,"Sorry, sorry, my name is {PlayerName}, I came here to request something from Senior Fu Yaozi, may I know your name?",,抱歉抱歉，在下{PlayerName}，造访贵地是为了向扶摇子前辈请教一些事情，不知阁下怎么称呼？
Z005_6_6,"A jade flute under the bright moon, verdant beauty fills the east wind. I am Shen Mengxi.",,玉笛一天明月，翠华满陌东风。在下——沈梦溪。
Z005_6_7,"So you are Shen Mengxi? You seem quite calm and composed, it seems you are fearless!",,你就是沈梦溪？好一副气定神闲，看来是有恃无恐！
Z005_6_8,"Including you, you are the fifth person today who has been terrified upon hearing my name. Think about it, how could I, a half-disabled person, go to the manor to steal a sword, and leave traces for you to find?",,算上你，今天已是第五个听到我名字便如临大敌的家伙了。你冷静想一下，我这个半废之人怎能去山庄盗剑，又怎会留下行踪任凭你们找来。
Z005_6_9,"Who knows if you have been paralyzed for a long time and have become psychologically distorted! Extremely boring, causing trouble, and you are leisurely watching the drama...",,谁知道你会不会瘫痪久了，心理变态！无聊至极，闹出乱子，你好整以暇一旁看戏……
Z005-1_1_1,I found this in the Nameless village!,,我在无名小村找到了这个！
Z005-1_1_2,(Handed out the Animal ring - The Ox),,（把牛金牛兽环递了出去）
Z005-1_1_3,"I didn't expect that I, Shen Mengxi, would have the opportunity to re-enter the martial arts world in this life. Since someone has brought the Animal ring, I guess I am not breaking my oath.",,想不到我沈梦溪此生还有再入江湖的机会，既然有人找来兽环，那么我便不算违背誓言了。
Z005-1_2_1,"Let's go, we have to let those people know how much it costs to slander the reputation of the Linlang Academy and me, Shen Mengxi!",,咱们走吧，要让那伙人知道，诬蔑琳琅书院和我沈梦溪的清白究竟要付出多大的代价！
Z005-1_3_1,"Your team already has quite a few people, it seems that it doesn't matter whether I help or not, I won't join the fun.",,你的队伍已经不少人了，看来是否有我相助都无甚要紧，我便不去凑热闹了。
Z005-2_1_1,"It seems that I have offended the old Village Head, he is hiding and dare not see me. It seems that I have no chance with the token left by Shen Mengxi.",,好像得罪了老村长，他躲起来不敢见我了。看来我跟沈梦溪留下的信物无缘了。
Z006_1_1,Who's there?,,来者何人？
Z006_1_10,Do you suspect that the Xuanyuan sword was stolen by us from the Confucius Temple? This is simply absurd!,,看样子你是怀疑轩辕剑是我们儒圣馆盗走的？简直滑天下之大稽！
Z006_1_11,"I heard that you are best at talking about morality and righteousness, but you are despicable and dirty behind your back. Since you are the most suspicious, I have to search!",,听说你们最擅长嘴上仁义道德，背后却卑鄙下流，这种肮脏事情你们既然嫌疑最大，说不得只好动手搜一搜了！
Z006_1_12,Presumptuous!,,放肆！
Z006_1_2,"Call your manager, I have a few words to ask him!",,把你们管事的叫来，我问他几句话！
Z006_1_3,"The master is not in the hall today, and the eldest son <color=#c44b0e>Cai Youzhi</color> is acting on behalf of the master.",,馆主今日不在馆内，大公子<color=#c44b0e>蔡攸之</color>代行馆主之责。

Z006_1_6,"Your master is hiding now, isn't he afraid that I will expose him and he is too ashamed to see people?",,你们馆主此时躲了出去，莫不是知道我要来揭穿他，没脸见人了？
Z006_1_7,"What nonsense are you talking about, my father is busy all day, his whereabouts are uncertain. What does it have to do with you, a nameless pawn!",,你说什么狗屁话，家父日理万机，行踪不定。跟你这个无名小卒有什么干系！
Z006_1_8,"I don't care about your grievances with the Linlang Academy, but the Sword Saint has spoken. Whoever finds the stolen Xuanyuan sword, the sword belongs to him!",,你们跟琳琅书院有什么恩怨纠纷我管不着，但是剑圣前辈发话了，谁把盗走的轩辕剑找到，此剑就归谁所有！
Z006_1_9,"So you are also innocent, but guilty of holding the jade.",,所以你们也算是君子无罪，怀璧其罪了。
Z006_2_1,"If you provoke our Confucius Temple, no matter which sect you are a disciple of, you will not be able to stand in the martial arts world!",,惹了我们儒圣馆，且不管你是哪派弟子，都将无法在江湖立足！

Z006_2_5,"You are not as skilled as others, shut up!",,技不如人的东西，把嘴给我闭上！

Z007_1_4,"(Read the letter carefully) It turns out that Ye Yinping is now in Bianzhou City, and it seems that she has encountered some trouble and wants me to help. Now there is no clue about the Xuanyuan sword, so I might as well go to <color=#c44b0e>Bianzhou City</color> to help Ye Yinping.",,（仔细阅读信件）原来叶银瓶现在汴州城，似乎遇到了什么麻烦事情要找我帮忙。现在轩辕剑一事尚无头绪，索性就去<color=#c44b0e>汴州城</color>帮帮叶银瓶那妹子吧。

留叶云在此接应你….."

做大事不拘小节，若非如此圣物何年何月才能迎回。"

Chai Wangye and the visiting guests exchange pleasantries one by one, followed by the guests taking turns to present gifts and mutual flattery...
The whole process and style are no different from the birthday celebrations of wealthy households you've seen in the countryside.

You look at them, suddenly feeling a sense of disillusionment, until a shrill voice comes...",,"随着众宾客的落座，柴王爷的寿宴正式开始。
柴王爷和来访宾客们逐一客套一番，接着来访宾客轮番助寿献礼，双方相互吹捧……
整套流程和做派跟你在乡里看见的富户财主过生日没什么两样。
若这就是江湖，那我何必背井离乡来这里闯荡？
