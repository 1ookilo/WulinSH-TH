guid-1_username1,A young and pleasant female voice,เสียงสตรีที่ไพเราะเสนาะหู
guid-1_username2,A cute and obedient girl,หญิงสาวน่ารักและว่านอนสอนง่าย
guid-1_1_1,"Hey! Wake up!\nIf you don't wake up, I'm going to draw a turtle on your face!","นี่! ตื่นเดี๋ยวนี้!\nหากเจ้ายังไม่ตื่นข้าจะวาดรูปเต่าลงบนหน้าเจ้าแล้วนะ!"
guid-1_1_2,"Don't bother me sleeping, if you want to draw, just draw, anyway you can't draw it right...",ปล่อยข้านอนเถอะ หากเจ้าอยากจะวาดก็วาด ยังไงเจ้าก็วาดไม่เป็นรูปอยู่ดี....
guid-1_1_3,"It sounds like a little girl's voice!!!\nIs there a thief in the house, or did I sleep in the wrong place???","นี่ฟังดูเหมือนเสียงเด็กผู้หญิง!!!\nมีโจรเข้ามาในบ้าน หรือว่าข้านอนหลับผิดที่กันแน่เนี่ย???"
guid-1_1_4,"You're so annoying, brother. If you woke up a little later, this turtle could have been more lifelike.",ศิษย์พี่นี่น่ารำคาญจริงๆ หากท่านตื่นมาช้ากว่านี้ล่ะก็ เต่าข้าคงจะเดินได้แล้ว
guid-1_1_5,"Who are you, girl? Who is your brother?",เจ้าคือใครหรือแม่นาง ใครคือศิษย์พี่ของเจ้า
guid-1_1_6,"It's terrible, your Iron Head skill has completely broken internally, a few bricks have made you stupid.",แย่แล้ว แย่แล้ว เจ้าคงจะสูญเสียวิชาหัวเหล็กกล้าไปแล้วสินะ แค่อิฐไม่กี่ก้อนก็ทำให้เจ้าโง่ลงเสียแล้ว
guid-1_1_7,"Hey, who are you calling stupid?!\nIf it weren't for your cuteness, I would have been rude to you!","นี่ เจ้าเรียกใครว่าโง่กันน่ะ?!\nถ้าหากไม่เพราะความน่ารักของเจ้า ข้าคงจะไม่ไว้หน้าเจ้าแล้ว!"
guid-1_1_8,"Looking at you, you probably don't even remember your own name, what's wrong, are you not the idiot, or am I?",ดูท่าแล้วเจ้าคงจะจำแม้แต่ชื่อของตนเองไม่ได้ ถ้าไม่เรียกว่าโง่แล้วจะให้เรียกว่าอะไร?
guid-1_1_9,"How could I not remember my own name, I'm called...",ข้าจะจำชื่อตนเองไม่ได้ได้อย่างไร ข้าน่ะชื่อ...
guid-1_2_1,"Oh dear, you didn't forget your own name, there's still hope.",เกือบไปแล้ว ยังดีที่เจ้ายังพอจะจำชื่อตัวเองได้
guid-1_2_2,"Speaking of... who are you, girl?\nI'm not used to having a girl squatting next to me while I'm sleeping.","ว่าแต่....แม่นางเป็น..ใคร?\nข้าไม่ชินกับการที่มีหญิงสาวมานั่งยองข้างๆข้าเวลาที่ข้ากำลังหลับหรอกนะ"
guid-1_2_3,"I'm your lively and cute little junior sister,\nToday is the big day for you to take over as the sect leader, I came to remind you.","ข้าก็คือศิษย์น้องหญิงผู้น่ารักและเลอโฉมของเจ้ายังไงล่ะ\nวันนี้คือวันสำคัญที่เจ้าจะต้องเข้ารับตำแหน่งเจ้าสำนัก ข้าเลยมาเตือน"
guid-1_2_4,"I'm sorry... My mind is a bit muddled as I just woke up. Please don't take it to heart. Since you're my junior sister, we should have a master, right? And, what sect are we from?",ขอโทษที... ข้ายังรู้สึกเมาหัวหลังจากตื่นอยู่เลย ในเมื่อเจ้าเป็นศิษย์น้องหญิงของข้า แปลว่าเราทั้งคู่ควรที่จะมีอาจารย์ใช่ไหม? แล้ว..เรามาจากสำนักอะไรกันล่ะ?
guid-1_2_5,"Our master has gone on a journey around the world. Before he left, he entrusted the sect to you and asked you to give it a powerful name, so we can hold our heads high in the martial world.",ท่านอาจารย์ของเราได้ออกไปท่องยุทธภพแล้วล่ะ แต่ก่อนท่านจะออกเดินทางได้ฝากสำนักไว้กับท่าน และขอให้ท่านเป็นคนแต่งตั้งชื่อที่สุดแสนจะเท่ห์และเลิศเลอสะท้านไปทั้งยุธภพ
guid-1_2_6,"It's strange, with my profound wisdom, I can't figure out what our cheap master is thinking.",แปลกจัง ด้วยสติปัญญาอันเฉลียวฉลาดของข้า แต่กลับไม่สามารถเข้าถึงความคิดของท่านอาจารย์ได้
guid-1_2_7,"Our master is far-sighted, it's not for us disciples to guess his intentions. You should quickly give our sect a new name. You're going to be the new sect leader.",อาจารย์ของเราเป็นคนรู้จักมองการไกล ศิษย์อย่างเราไม่จำเป็นต้องเข้าใจเจตนาของท่านก็ได้ ท่านควรรีบตั้งชื่อสำนักของเราใหม่ได้แล้ว ในเมื่อท่านกำลังจะกลายเป็นเจ้าสำนักคนใหม่นะ
guid-1_2_8,The new name of the sect is...,ชื่อของสำนักของเราคือ....
guid-1_3_1,"What a good choice, brother. The new name is indeed catchy and meaningful.",ตั้งได้แจ่มมากศิษย์พี่ ชื่อใหม่นี่มันไฉไลและมีความหมายที่ลึกซึ้งสุดๆ
guid-1_3_2,Please call me Sect Leader Brother!,เรียกข้าว่าศิษย์พี่เจ้าสำนักสิ!
guid-1_3_3,"Yes, greetings Sect Leader Brother~",ค่าา ศิษย์พี่เจ้าสำนัก~
guid-1_3_4,(I've inexplicably traveled through time and become a sect leader. It seems my new life is full of challenges!),(อยู่ดีๆข้าก็ท่องห้วงกาลเวลามาเป็นเจ้าสำนัก เหมือนกับว่าชีวิตใหม่ของข้ากำลังจะเริ่มต้นด้วยสิ่งท้าทายมากมาย)
guid-1_3_5,"I will overcome all obstacles and carry out the master's will to make our sect great, making all the sects in the martial world respect us!",ข้าจะขจัดสิ่งขวางกั้น และทำตามเจตจำนงค์ของท่านอาจารย์เพื่อให้สำนักของเรายิ่งใหญ่ ทำให้ทุกสำนักในใต้หล้าต้องยอมรับให้ได้!
guid-1_3_6,"Now, to make the entire martial world notice our sect, I will lead our sect to take the first step towards dominating the martial world!",ตอนนี้เพื่อจะให้ถึงเป้าหมายนั้น ข้าจะนำพาสำนักของเราเริ่มก้าวแรกเข้าสู่การครองยุทธภพ!
guid-1_3_7,"That's so inspiring! I didn't expect you, Sect Leader Brother, to have such a passionate side. I admire you even more now.",ฟังแล้วตื้นตันอย่างยิ่ง ข้าแทบไม่เชื่อหูตัวเองว่าศิษย์พี่เจ้าสำนักจะมีด้านที่โรแมนติกอย่างนี้อยู่ด้วย ชักจะเลื่อมใสในตัวท่านซะแล้วสิ
guid-1_3_8,"According to this map, there's a Blue Wind Camp not far from our sect. This weak force is perfect for us to establish our authority.",ตามแผนที่นี้ ค่ายวายุครามอยู่ไม่ห่างจากสำนักเรามาก กองกำลังที่อ่อนแอนี้ช่างเหมาะเจาะที่จะเป็นบันได้ก้าวแรกสู่การสร้างชื่อของสำนักเรา
guid-1_3_9,"Junior sister, call all the disciples of our sect and immediately follow me to conquer the Blue Wind Camp!",ศิษย์น้องหญิง เรียกรวมเหล่าศิษย์ทั้งหมดและตามข้าไปบุกยึดค่ายวายุคราม!
guid-1_3_10,"Sect Leader Brother, you're so fierce. You're going to establish your authority by attacking the Blue Wind Camp first. That's so...",ศิษย์พี่เจ้าสำนักท่านช่างดุดันยิ่ง ท่านกำลังจะสร้างชื่อด้วยการโจมตีค่ายวายุครามเป็นอันดับแรก นี่มันช่าง....
guid-1_3_11,"That's so reckless! Wait for me, brother, the Blue Wind Camp is not as weak as you think...",ช่างงี่เง่าสิ้นดี! รอข้าก่อนศิษย์พี่ ค่ายวายุครามไม่ได้อ่อนแออย่างที่ท่านคิดนะ....

guid-2_1_1,"Junior sister, this outcome is a bit different from what I expected...",ซือเม่ย... ผลลัพธ์มันช่าง... แตกต่างจากที่ข้าคาดการณ์ไว้ยิ่งนัก!
guid-2_1_2,"Isn't it because you, Sect Leader Brother, overestimated yourself and rushed into their camp, shouting ""I want to fight ten of you!"" and then got beaten up, haha."
guid-2_1_3,Our sect is even weaker than the Blue Wind Camp... Who could have guessed that!,สำนักเรายังอ่อนแอกว่าค่ายวายุครามอีกงั้นรึ... ใครจะไปคาดคิดกัน!
guid-2_1_4,"This grudge must be avenged! Blue Wind Camp, wait until I master my skills, I'll make you pay!",แค้นนี้ต้องชำระ! ค่ายวายุคราม รอข้าฝึกวิทยายุทธ์จนบรรลุก่อนเถอะ ข้าจะกลับมาล้างแค้นให้สาสม!
guid-2_1_5,"Sect Leader Brother, don't rush to make threats. Your handsome face now looks like a pig's head. If you don't heal, it will be swollen for life."
guid-2_1_6,"That won't do, my face is the face of our sect, it's very important.\nJunior sister, help me think of a solution!","เช่นนั้นมิได้ดอก! ใบหน้านี้ช่างสำคัญยิ่ง เป็นถึงหน้าตาของสำนักเราเชียวนะ!\nศิษย์น้องหญิง เจ้าช่วยพี่คิดหน่อยเถิด!"
guid-2_2_1,"Phew... Finally, I'm handsome again.\nBut why do I feel that my HP and MP haven't recovered to their best state?","ฮู่ววว... ในที่สุดก็หล่อเหลาเหมือนเดิมเสียที \nแต่อืม... เหตุใดข้าจึงรู้สึกว่า พลังลมปราณกับพลังภายในยังไม่ฟื้นฟูถึงขีดสุดนะ"
guid-2_2_2,"As the saying goes, ""Muscle injuries take a hundred days to heal"". Even your cute junior sister can't make you, who is near death, vigorous and lively immediately.",ดั่งคำโบราณว่าไว้ 'บาดแผลกล้ามเนื้อต้องใช้เวลาร้อยวันจึงจะหาย' แม้แต่ศิษย์น้องหญิงร่วมสำนักผู้น่ารักของเจ้าก็ไม่อาจทำให้เจ้าที่ใกล้ม้วยมรณาฟื้นคืนชีพและกระปรี้กระเปร่าได้ในชั่วพริบตา
guid-2_2_3,"Junior sister, you must insist on healing me every day. I really don't like this feeling of being half-dead.",ศิษย์น้องหญิง เจ้าต้องยืนกรานรักษาอาการข้าทุกวัน ข้าไม่ชอบความรู้สึกเหมือนอยู่ในภวังค์ระหว่างความเป็นความตายเช่นนี้เลย

guid-3_1_1,"Junior sister, I'm quite puzzled. Were you just standing by and watching when I was being beaten up by the Mountain Bandits of Blue Wind Camp?",ศิษย์น้องหญิง ข้ารู้สึกสงสัยยิ่งนัก เจ้าเพียงแต่ยืนดูอยู่เฉยๆ ตอนที่ข้าถูกพวกโจรภูเขาจากค่ายวายุคราม รุมซ้อมอย่างนั้นหรือ?
guid-3_1_2,"What else could I do? Should I, a girl, get beaten up with you? In the end, there would be no one to help us heal.",ข้าจะทำเช่นไรได้อีกเล่า? เจ้าอยากให้สตรีน้อยเช่นข้าต้องร่วมชกต่อยกับเจ้าด้วยหรือ? ท้ายที่สุด จะไม่มีเหลือผู้ใดให้ช่วยรักษาบาดแผลของพวกเจ้า
guid-3_1_3,Are there only two of us in our sect?
guid-3_1_4,"Yes, I was about to remind the sect leader to recruit more people. Otherwise, now that you've become the sect leader, there's no one to do chores like fetching water and chopping wood.",ใช่ ข้ากำลังจะเตือนเจ้าสำนักเรื่องการรับศิษย์เพิ่มเติมพอดี มิเช่นนั้น บัดนี้ที่ท่านได้ขึ้นเป็นเจ้าสำนักแล้ว จะไม่มีผู้ใดคอยทำงานเล็กๆ น้อยๆ เช่นตักน้ำหรือผ่าฟืน
guid-3_1_5,"If possible, I would like to leave the sect and wander the world right now.\nOur sect is so desolate, how can we recruit people?"
guid-3_1_6,"With the personal charm of your smart and cute junior sister~\nI'll help you recruit personally, and we'll definitely get talented young talents~","ด้วยเสน่ห์อันล้ำเลิศของศิษย์น้องหญิงผู้เฉลียวฉลาดและน่ารักของท่าน~\nข้าจะช่วยท่านคัดสรรศิษย์ด้วยตนเอง รับรองว่าจะได้ยอดฝีมือรุ่นเยาว์มาอย่างแน่นอน~"
guid-4_name,Promote Disciple,เลื่อนขั้นลูกศิษย์
guid-4_log,"Promote any disciple through the <color=#00FF00>Management</color> function, or directly enter the next round.",เลื่อนขั้นศิษย์คนใดก็ได้ผ่านระบบ <color=#00FF00> บริหารสำนัก </color> หรือเข้าสู่รอบถัดไปโดยตรง
guid-4_1_1,"Junior sister, why do I find that the money in the sect has suddenly decreased?",ศิษย์น้องหญิง เหตุใดข้าจึงพบว่าเงินทองในคลังสำนักลดลงอย่างฉับพลันเช่นนี้?
guid-4_1_2,"We just recruited two disciples, did you forget, sect leader?\nTalented people not only have high <color=#00FF00>recruitment costs</color>, but also need to pay a considerable salary every month.","พวกเราเพิ่งรับศิษย์ใหม่สองคนเข้าสำนัก ท่านเจ้าสำนักลืมไปแล้วหรือ?\nยอดฝีมือนั้นมิใช่เพียงมี <color=#00FF00>ค่าใช้จ่ายในการรับเข้าสำนัก </color> ที่สูงลิ่วเท่านั้น แต่ยังต้องจ่ายค่าตอบแทนรายเดือนอีกจำนวนมากอีกด้วย"
guid-4_1_3,"I thought with your charm, junior sister, you could gather a crowd with a single call. I didn't expect that we still need to spend money in the end.",ข้านึกว่าด้วยเสน่ห์ของศิษย์น้องหญิง เพียงเอ่ยปากเรียกก็จะมีผู้คนหลั่งไหลมาสมัครเป็นศิษย์เสียอีก ไม่คาดคิดว่าท้ายที่สุดแล้วพวกเราก็ยังต้องสิ้นเปลืองเงินทองอยู่ดี
guid-4_1_4,"If you want to recruit people, don't be afraid to spend money. If the treatment is not good, why would people follow you? Is it because of your self-righteous handsome face?",หากต้องการรับคนเข้าสำนัก อย่าได้กลัวการใช้จ่าย หากไม่ให้ผลตอบแทนที่ดี ผู้ใดเล่าจะยอมติดตามพวกเจ้า? หรือว่าพวกเจ้าคิดว่าโฉมหน้าอันงดงามที่เจ้าหลงตัวเองนักหนานั้นจะดึงดูดผู้คนได้?
guid-4_1_5,"I hope the spending can come to an end, otherwise if this continues, I, the new sect leader, can only declare bankruptcy and close the sect.",ข้าหวังว่าการใช้จ่ายนี้จะสิ้นสุดลงเสียที มิเช่นนั้นหากยังคงเป็นเช่นนี้ต่อไป ข้าผู้เป็นเจ้าสำนักคนใหม่คงต้องประกาศล้มละลายและปิดสำนักเสียแล้ว
guid-4_1_6,"Oh, this is far from enough. For such talented disciples, I suggest <color=#00FF00>promoting</color> them to more promising inner disciples. Although the monthly expenditure is slightly higher, it can maximize the growth limit, which is very cost-effective in the long run!"
guid-4_1_7,Spending money again... My heart aches...
guid-4_1_8,"If the sect leader doesn't know which disciple to promote for a while, why not <color=#00FF00>promote</color> your cutest junior sister first? I'm your most staunch supporter~"

guid-5_log,Improve the martial arts skills of the disciples through <color=#00FF00>Learning</color> or directly enter the next round.
guid-5_1_1,"You, the new guy, come and practice with me, the sect leader, so I can train you well."
guid-5_1_2,"Sect leader, no! My wounds from yesterday haven't healed yet, ah..."
guid-5_1_3,"Hey! I haven't even made a move yet, how come you've already fallen? I, the sect leader, am truly invincible, haha!"
guid-5_1_4,"Senior brother, is it fun to bully the weak?"
guid-5_1_5,"Junior sister, you misunderstood, I'm just guiding their martial arts!"
guid-5_1_6,So the way the sect leader guides others in martial arts is to beat them up without letting them fight back?
guid-5_1_7,Then... how should I improve their martial arts skills?
guid-5_1_8,"Of course, let them consume resources in the sect's training room to learn on their own. As the saying goes, it's better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish. Being their strong support is much better than spoiling them by helping too much!"
guid-5_1_9,"Junior sister, you know how poor our sect is. If we keep training like this, we'll probably go bankrupt... Is there a free, completely free way?"
guid-5_1_10,"If you want it for free, of course there is. It depends on whether you, senior brother, are willing."
guid-5_1_11,"Hey, for the development of our sect, there's nothing I, the sect leader, am unwilling to do. Speak up!"
guid-5_1_12,"There's a wooden dummy outside. Senior brother, you first tie yourself to it, and I'll go call the disciples to line up."
guid-5_1_13,"Then let them use me as a human punching bag, right?"
guid-5_1_14,"Hehe, who made you, senior brother, so selfless and dedicated~"

guid-6_1_1,"Sect leader senior brother, something terrible has happened!"
guid-6_1_2,"Do you remember the embarrassing incident last time when you tried to show off against Blue Wind Camp but ended up being beaten up? This time they are coming at us with great momentum, probably intending to destroy your prestige and boost their morale."
guid-6_1_3,"I'll go change my clothes, junior sister, you quickly pack up, we'll take the back mountain path, if we don't run now, it'll be too late!"
guid-6_1_4,"Senior brother, as the sect leader, you're too cowardly."
guid-6_1_5,"My peerless martial arts are not yet accomplished, if I don't leave now, I'll get beaten up again, I don't want to have nightmares again."
guid-6_1_6,"Don't panic, senior brother! The small animals I've been taming in the back mountain can finally come in handy. When the people from Blue Wind Camp come, they'll have a hard time!"
guid-6_1_7,"The small animals in the back mountain, aren't they just a bunch of chicks? They're more like midnight snacks for others, are you planning to stuff them to death... Junior sister, I bid you farewell, we'll meet again in the future——"
guid-6_1_8,"Who dares to block my way, don't blame me for being rude!"
guid-6_1_9,"Cluck cluck, cluck cluck cluck..."
guid-6_1_10,What a move... genuine... chicken claw skill...
guid-6_1_11,"Senior brother, why are you back? I thought we were never going to meet again~"
guid-6_1_12,"Junior sister, you won't believe it... I was beaten by a chicken..."
guid-6_1_13,"Hmph, this is called don't judge a chicken by its appearance!"
guid-6_1_14,"Hey, did we take a wrong turn..."
guid-6_1_15,"How could it be, I know this road very well, Li Erniu showed me this place when he mortgaged his courtyard."
guid-6_1_16,"Look, isn't it right in front of us? This courtyard will soon belong to our Blue Wind Camp."
guid-6_1_17,"Li Erniu, pay your debts! If you can't pay today, your courtyard will be used to offset the debt!"
guid-6_1_18,"Who's making such a racket in front of someone else's house early in the morning, who's so lacking in public morals?"
guid-6_1_19,"Have you heard of the famous Blue Wind Camp? If Li Erniu doesn't pay up today, this place will become the property of Blue Wind Camp."
guid-6_1_20,What does it matter to me whether Li Erniu or Li Daniu pays back the money!
guid-6_1_21,"Sect leader senior brother, our master... his name is Li Erniu."
guid-6_1_22,No wonder this name sounds so honest and simple. I really don't understand how he could have provoked Blue Wind Camp. Did he impulsively challenge them like me?
guid-6_1_23,"Your master borrowed a huge sum of money from our Blue Wind Camp a few days ago, using this courtyard as collateral."
guid-6_1_24,"Damn... So this cheap master of mine claimed to go on a journey, but actually ran away with the money..."
guid-6_1_25,"You have two choices, one, pay back the money you owe our Blue Wind Camp, two, get out of here as soon as possible."
guid-6_1_26,"Daydreaming in broad daylight, neither of these options is possible!"
guid-6_1_27,"Good, you've got guts! My brother and I will block the door, none of you can leave, let's see who can outlast who!"
guid-6_1_28,You two are really pushing your luck...
guid-6_1_29,"Senior Brother, this is our territory, why not take advantage of the dark night and deal with them..."
guid-6_2_1,"Dare to fight back! With the cost of the Soup medicine, even in your next life, you won't be able to pay it off."
guid-6_2_2,"Our Big Boss won't let you go, if you have the guts, stay here and wait for death!"
guid-6_2_3,Two heavily wounded Thugs limped back to the Blue Wind Camp.

guid-7_1_1,"Let's settle the vendetta together, even if we don't wipe out the Blue Wind Camp, they will never let us go."
guid-7_1_2,"There's always a way out, Senior Brother, don't be too pessimistic."
guid-7_1_3,Is there any way to quickly enhance the strength of our sect? The guys from Blue Wind Camp won't wait for us to develop slowly.
guid-7_1_4,"Let me think... Ah, I got it!"
guid-7_1_5,"Master once told me that if you want to develop and strengthen a sect, the leader must gather wisdom and listen to the Disciples' opinions."
guid-7_1_6,"Our sect was originally poor, thanks to our Master's month-long meditation, he came up with the idea of borrowing money from Blue Wind Camp to solve the urgent need."
guid-7_1_7,"Yes, then the Master took the money and ran away to hide from the debt, leaving us two to continue being poor."
guid-7_1_8,"I was just giving an example, an example, understand!"
guid-7_1_9,"You mean, arrange for the Disciple to <color=#00FF00>meditate</color>, let them come up with all kinds of strange ideas..."
guid-7_1_10,"Yes! Then as the leader, you can collect their ideas and use them in the development plan of the sect. When our strength has increased to a certain level, Blue Wind Camp will no longer be a threat."
guid-7_1_11,"How about it, am I smart! Go find a Disciple with exceptional intelligence to try it out."
guid-7_1_12,Where can I find a Disciple with exceptional intelligence...
guid-7_1_13,"The person with the highest intelligence in our sect is far away in the sky, but close at hand..."

guid-8_1_1,"Good, it seems you finally know how to collect the ideas of the Disciples."
guid-8_1_2,"Isn't it, staring at the wall in that thatched house for a whole month, I almost went crazy! If it wasn't for the sake of flattening Blue Wind Camp..."
guid-8_1_3,"Now that you have the ideas of the Disciples, you can use them to make a big splash in the sect's planning. Whether to prioritize the development of various resources or to prioritize the training of Guard Disciples, use your brain to arrange them in order."
guid-8_1_4,"There are so many potential planning directions, how do I know which one to research first! Right, our sect only has four people in total, there is no grandeur of a big sect, we must first research how to expand the recruitment of Disciples!"
guid-8_1_5,"Stop! If you recruit so many people, each one needs to be fed and housed, our sect can't afford it!"
guid-8_1_6,"In my opinion, resource construction is the key to the development of our sect. Our {0} has always produced food, but we don't have resources like herbs. What if one day you are heavily injured and we are short of herbs in the sect?"
guid-8_1_7,"I know that. If there's no herb, just eat more to replenish nutrition, which will help the body recover quickly."
guid-8_1_8,Your way of thinking is quite... unique... of course...
guid-8_1_9,"Of course what? Of course, I'm right?"
guid-8_1_10,"Of course, we should exchange food for herbs with merchants, you fool!"
guid-8_1_11,"As long as we first plan out how to contact resource merchants, we can exchange surplus resources for scarce ones through <color=#00FF00>trading</color> with them."
guid-8_2_1,"Junior sister, there's something I'm not sure whether to say or not..."
guid-8_2_2,Don't say it! Keep it to yourself.
guid-8_2_3,"I have to say it. According to this plan, we need money to contact merchants, otherwise they will think we are frauds and dare not bring their caravans to do business."
guid-8_2_4,"You, in just a few months, have squandered all the savings of our sect, haven't you?"
guid-8_2_5,"I swear, every coin was carefully calculated and used for the development of the sect, without any waste!"
guid-8_2_6,"Sigh, no one can be a sect leader like you. Here's some private money I've saved, you can use it."
guid-8_2_7,"Junior sister, I knew you would always be the most caring one for me..."
guid-8_2_8,"Three percent interest per month, thank you for your patronage! My future dowry depends on you, senior brother~"
guid-8_2_9,You're not my junior sister... you're a loan shark!

guid-9_1_2,"The sect leader is sleeping, he's not here..."
guid-9_1_3,What are you sleeping for? The merchants are here! We can't keep them waiting too long!
guid-9_1_4,"Senior brother, let me tell you, merchants are the most profit-driven and value trustworthiness the most. If you stand them up and make them come for nothing, be prepared to be blacklisted by all the major business associations!"
guid-9_1_5,Is it that serious...
guid-9_1_6,"Yes, it is! The amount of goods brought by resource merchants each time represents the weight of our sect's trustworthiness in their hearts. If you want them to increase the goods they bring, you need to expand in the sect's plan."
guid-9_1_7,"Alright, alright, I'll go, okay?"
guid-9_1_8,"Dear sect leader, remember to buy what you lack, if you get it wrong, be prepared to sell yourself to pay off the debt!"

guid-10_1_2,"Martial arts manuals? You mean the Sky Destroying Palm, the Thousand Miles Meteor Sword, the Sky Tearing Thunderbolt Blade?"
guid-10_1_3,"Yes, yes, those. Such domineering names must be peerless martial arts!"
guid-10_1_4,"Sorry, we don't have any of the above martial arts in our sect."
guid-10_1_5,"...\nSo what do we have in our sect?"
guid-10_1_6,"We only have one martial art created by our master in his later years, called Dexterous Hand."
guid-10_1_7,"I always feel that this martial arts is not in the same dimension as before...\nWell, it's better to have it than not. It will increase our chances of defeating the Blue Wind Camp."
guid-10_1_8,"Head brother, if you don't want to face the entire Blue Wind Camp alone in the future, don't forget to let the disciples learn some martial arts to enhance their strength."
guid-10_1_9,Uh... let me think about it.
guid-10_2_1,"Phew... After using so many brain cells, I finally figured out this martial arts haha!"

guid-11_1_1,The disciples have practiced martial arts in a decent way. Is there any other way to improve their strength? I'm still a little unsure about defeating the Blue Wind Camp...
guid-11_1_2,"Of course! In addition to martial arts, each sect has some unique objects that carry the martial arts intentions of their predecessors. These can be given to disciples for comprehension, allowing them to understand different martial arts features."
guid-11_1_3,"These features have different effects. As long as they are equipped, martial arts talents can immediately step up."
guid-11_1_4,"That's so cool! The exclusive features of our sect must be very powerful. Let me guess, is it invulnerability or the ability to hit a cow across a mountain?"
guid-11_1_5,"Uh... neither, you'll see for yourself."
guid-11_1_6,"Light body? Junior sister, did our master always have dirty hands and feet?"
guid-11_1_7,"Considering our master's habit of running away from debts, I find it hard to refute..."
guid-12_name,Duel
guid-12_log,"Through ""events"", send disciples to watch the duel of masters."
guid-12_1_1,"Junior sister, have you heard? There's big news recently. Two martial arts masters who have been in seclusion for many years not only came out of the mountains, but also decided to have an inseparable duel on a mountain near us."
guid-12_1_2,"What, you want to go and watch the excitement, senior brother?"
guid-12_1_3,"Hey, it's not about excitement. The duel just happens to be in our sect's territory. As the head, I naturally have to go and show some hospitality."
guid-12_1_4,"Hospitality? In my opinion, you just want to get familiar with the masters, and hopefully persuade one with a thin face to help you deal with the Blue Wind Camp."
guid-12_1_5,"Junior sister, you exposed me so quickly, it really makes me lose face..."
guid-12a_name,Watching the duel of masters
guid-12a_log,"It is said that two martial arts masters are having an inseparable duel on a nearby mountain. You, being curious, decide to go and find out."
guid-12a_1_1,Your sword is very fast. Even the head of Langya Sword Pavilion would have to work hard to beat you.
guid-12a_1_2,Your knife is not bad. Even the knife skills of the Jiujiang Fortress leader probably won't be much stronger than yours.
guid-12a_1_3,"There's no point in talking more, make your move!"
guid-12a_1_4,Please!
guid-12a_1_5,"The two masters come and go, each showing their lifelong skills, fighting into a group. In just a few breaths, they have fought dozens of moves."
guid-12a_1_6,"The martial arts of you two are evenly matched. It's impossible to tell the winner this way. Why not drop the weapons and decide the winner with MP alone, how about it?"
guid-12a_1_7,That's exactly what I want! You think I will lose if we compare MP!
guid-12a_1_8,"The two dropped their weapons and each threw a palm at each other\nAt the intersection of the two palms, endless MP seems to be rolling\nLarge drops of sweat continuously slide down from their cheeks, hitting the ground with a ticking sound."
guid-12a_1_9,"Phew... I finally made it... These two masters haven't decided the winner yet, it's time for me to show up!"
guid-12a_1_10,"Both of them look incredibly strong, who should I greet and build relations with first?"
guid-12a_op1,The stern martial artist with a knife
guid-12a_op2,The handsome martial artist with a sword
guid-12a_3_1,"The hero with the knife, I, the head of {MyFaction}, pay my respects!"
guid-12a_4_1,"The hero with the sword, I, the head of {MyFaction}, pay my respects!"
guid-12a_5_1,Puff...
guid-12a_5_2,Uh...
guid-12a_5_3,"The two masters were facing an inseparable strong enemy, they were fully focused on fighting with their MP\nUnexpectedly, under your sudden shock,\nBoth of them were unstable, spitting blood\nIn a short while, they died on the spot due to MP backlash"
guid-12a_5_4,"This... I just greeted them, how did they die inexplicably..."
guid-12a_5_5,"Why are there two strange things on the ground? Are they the legendary Martial Arts features? Never mind, I'll pick them up first, I can't run this trip for nothing."
guid-13_name,Eliminate <color=#00FF00>Blue Wind Camp</color>
guid-13_log,"Improve the strength of the disciples under the door, attack Blue Wind Camp."
guid-13_1_1,"Senior brother, you look particularly energetic today, is there any good news?"
guid-13_1_2,"I checked the almanac this morning, it said that the east is favorable, it's a good day to break the Blue Wind Camp!"
guid-13_1_3,"Now our sect is full of talents, it's indeed time to settle accounts with those guys."
guid-13_1_4,"Blue Wind Camp, for the peace of the martial arts world, for the happiness of the people, I, leading {MyFaction}, declare war on you!"
guid-13_1_5,"Finally waited for this passionate day, senior brother, you are so cool!"
guid-13_1_6,"Senior brother, here's a surprise! This is the equipment I secretly ordered for you with my private money when I went down the mountain, I hope it can make you more powerful!"
guid-13_1_7,"I, the head, announce that all {MyFaction} disciples, follow me down the mountain, flatten Blue Wind Camp!"
guid-14_1_1,"Blue Wind Camp, which has been plaguing the area, is nothing more than this!"
guid-14_1_2,"Thanks to my leadership, I saved the sect from extinction. Now our sect's reputation is rising, and our momentum is like a rainbow. In the near future, Confucius Temple, Shifa Temple, Taoist Sect will also be conquered by me one by one!"
guid-14_1_3,"Dominating the Martial World is just around the corner!\nI will be the true Peak of Jianghu, hahaha!!!"
guid-14_1_4,"(Oh no, why is my head suddenly dizzy, is it because I laughed too loudly and got a little hypoxic...)"
guid-14_1_5,(Is this dream going to wake up... Damn... Why is it at this time...)
guid-14_1_6,(I still have a lot of things to do... I haven't unified the martial arts world yet...)
guid-14_1_7,(I don't even know what my junior sister's name is...)
guid-14_1_8,(I'm not willing to give up!!!)
guid-14_1_9,Can the unfinished business of unifying the martial arts world be realized in another dream?

GeneralQue-1_3_2,"But in recent years, the martial arts world has been in turmoil."
GeneralQue-1_3_3,"Most sects have been wiped out, and it seems unlikely that the Martial Arts Convention will be held again."
GeneralQue-1_3_4,"The era of one dominating sect is approaching, let me give you some of my collections over the years!"

GeneralQue-2_1_3,"If Me loses, I will teach you my <color=#00FF00>signature palm technique</color>, how about it?"
GeneralQue-2_2_1,"As expected of your reputation... I lost, take this Manual, I'll take my leave..."
GeneralQue-2_3_1,"Everyone said you were strong, but it turns out to be a false rumor, how boring, goodbye!"
GeneralQue-2_4_1,"The cold-hearted swordsman before was my Intimate friend, you may have defeated him, but you may not defeat Me!"
GeneralQue-2_4_2,"Have a fair fight with me, let's see if he didn't Learn well, or you guys are playing dirty!"
GeneralQue-2_4_3,"If you can defeat Me, I will give you the Manual of my <color=#00FF00>unique sword technique</color>."
GeneralQue-2_5_1,Good skills... He lost without injustice...
GeneralQue-2_5_2,"I'm willing to accept the loss, this <color=#00FF00>Nameless Sword</color> will be passed on to you."
GeneralQue-2_6_1,A bunch of mediocrities... How could you defeat my good friend? You must have used some cunning tricks!

GeneralQue-2_14_1,"Inferior skills, no need to fight again, this <color=#00FF00>Luminary Meteor Strike</color> Manual is yours."
GeneralQue-2_15_1,"I didn't expect you to be so weak, what's the point of testing such strength?"
GeneralQue-2_16_1,"I've written a new song, but no one can bear the true meaning of the song, I've been sorrowful for months, heartbroken."
GeneralQue-2_16_2,"If someone from your sect can listen to this song in its entirety, I will give you this <color=#00FF00>unique music score</color>."

GeneralQue-5_15_2,"The ambition of the nameless hero, there really are successors, this is your deserved reward!"
GeneralQue-5_16_1,It seems that it can only stop here... Come down and try again.
GeneralQue-6_1_1,"There was a sudden loud noise outside the sect, as if something had fallen from the sky?"
GeneralQue-6_name,The Man from the Sky
GeneralQue-6_log,"It seems that a person has fallen from the sky, should we send someone to investigate?"
GeneralQue-6_2_1,Where is this?
GeneralQue-6_2_2,"It seems familiar, but also different?"
GeneralQue-6_2_3,……
GeneralQue-6_2_4,"Hey! Kid, where is this place?"
GeneralQue-6_2_5,……
GeneralQue-6_2_6,Hmm? Are you mute? It seems I need to look around and ask someone who can talk.
GeneralQue-7_1_1,The stranger who fell from the sky last time is visiting again?
GeneralQue-7_name,Ill-intentioned Visitor
GeneralQue-7_log,"The stranger who fell from the sky last time is visiting, it seems he wants to challenge our sect."
GeneralQue-7_2_1,"(What's going on in this world? It feels like something is missing, where have all the royals gone?)"
GeneralQue-7_2_2,"(I did find some people I used to know, but they don't seem to recognize me...)"
GeneralQue-7_2_3,"(Never mind, let's continue to fulfill the unfulfilled wish of that world)"
GeneralQue-7_2_4,You!
GeneralQue-7_2_5,……
GeneralQue-7_2_6,What are you looking at? I'm talking to you! Are you here to accept my challenge?
GeneralQue-7_2_7,Are you here to challenge our sect?
GeneralQue-7_2_8,Of course! Stop talking and let's fight!
GeneralQue-7_3_1,"You're quite skilled! Remember, I'll challenge you again!"
GeneralQue-7_3_2,……
GeneralQue-7_4_1,"Hmm, a worthy opponent, then I'll take some of your coins as the fee for this challenge!"
GeneralQue-7_4_2,……

main-1_1_1,"You accidentally got involved in a complex parallel time and space\nHere the court is fighting internally, losing all control over the martial arts forces\nHere Yan country is weak, unable to become a strong external enemy\nThe major sects took this opportunity to expand their territories and attack each other\nLaunched the final assault on the undecided Peak of Jianghu sect\nThis different martial world is looking forward to a savior who can rectify the chaos"
main-1_1_2,Has the Disciple who went out to inquire about the news come back? Has the situation in the martial world eased a bit?
main-1_1_3,"He's back... just covered in wounds, lying in bed and crying out."
main-1_1_4,What? Who dares to attack our sect's Disciple!
main-1_1_5,"He inquired about the news all the way, and inexplicably got involved in the attacks and killings of other sects, it's a great fortune to be able to come back alive..."
main-1_1_6,"In such a situation, why didn't he take out the sect's token to prove his identity?"
main-1_1_7,"If he didn't take out the token, it would be fine. As soon as he took it out, the major sects fought even harder..."
main-1_1_8,"Nonsense! Our sect has always maintained neutrality, other sects will give face, how can there be a reason to fight harder?"
main-1_1_9,It's because our sect maintains neutrality that they don't believe it...
main-1_1_10,"In the eyes of those sects, we are just a competitor who also covets the Peak of Jianghu sect, making a fortune in silence, posing a greater threat."
main-1_1_11,It's unbearable!
main-1_1_12,"I originally had some illusions about this, but now it seems that I was completely wrong..."
main-1_1_13,"This martial world is incurable, and those ambitious wolves can't be allowed to continue to wreak havoc."
main-1_1_14,"Pass the order, {MyFaction} for self-preservation, no longer endure neutrality..."
main-1_1_15,"One must break before rebuilding, only then can a new world be created!"
main-1_1_16,"Yes, sir!"
main-2_1_1,How is the inventory in the Sect's Storage Room going?
main-2_1_2,The inventory of all resources has been completed.
main-2_1_3,"Good! The martial world is like a battlefield now, and these resources are needed to play their part."
main-2_1_4,"By the way, I found a strange Token in the Storage Room."
main-2_1_5,This is the <color=#00FF00>Hao Ran Order</color>.
main-2_1_6,Is... is this the legendary Hao Ran Order?
main-2_1_7,"Back then, a nameless martial arts master who was unparalleled in the world, cast several Tokens from a meteorite, and this is one of them."
main-2_1_8,"It is rumored that the Hao Ran Order contains the unique skills of the nameless martial arts master. If one can master it, the achievement will be limitless."
main-2_1_9,Then... isn't this Token highly sought after?
main-2_1_10,"Although it is sought after, the rumor is actually a misunderstanding."
main-2_1_11,"Originally, this Token was just a certificate that the nameless martial arts master used to commend Defenders who contributed to the martial world, and there were no secret skills recorded in it."
main-2_1_12,"But those who do not know the truth are eager for it, and this small Token is enough to make a martial arts master willingly risk their life for you."
main-2_1_13,"In that case, it seems that we should pay more attention to collecting Hao Ran Orders in the future, to invite martial arts masters to help us deal with this martial world catastrophe."
main-2a_1_1,Disciple has a question and would like to request your guidance.
main-2a_1_2,Feel free to ask.
main-2a_1_3,"Since we have conquered the sect, why not completely eliminate the opponent, but let them escape into the martial world? Isn't this like releasing a tiger back into the mountain?"
main-2a_1_4,"The martial world is made up of people, and where there are people, there is the martial world."
main-2a_1_5,"Don't forget our original intention, it's not about killing, but about rebuilding the order of the martial world and ending this chaos. The so-called best strategy is to win people's hearts. I hope they can become my helpers in the future."
main-2a_1_6,"I see, so we need to unite all possible forces to neutralize this martial world catastrophe!"
main-2a_1_7,"Yes, I am."
main-3_1_1,"After occupying the opponent's sect, I found a very strange thing in their treasure house."
main-3_1_2,Oh? Show it to me...
main-3_1_3,This... this is actually a fragment of the nameless martial arts master's treasure!
main-3_1_4,"It seems that this martial world catastrophe is not as simple as I thought at first. The various sects are fighting each other, perhaps also for these things."
main-3_1_5,"What kind of ability does this nameless martial arts master have, why can his treasure fragments make the major sects fight for it?"
main-3_1_6,"This is a hidden matter in the martial world, it's normal that you don't know..."
main-3_1_7,"This nameless martial arts master has a mysterious background and unknown name. Not only does he have unparalleled martial arts skills, but he also cares about the world and stops killing."
main-3_1_8,It is said that the retreat of the Yan army and the destruction of the Imperial City Department were all his doing.
main-3_1_9,"Unfortunately, the nameless martial arts master does not like to show off, he works alone, and mysteriously disappeared a few years ago, otherwise he would be the master of the martial world."
main-3_1_10,"Destroying the Imperial City Department, breaking into the Yan army camp alone, such a heroic figure, indeed a dragon seen in the head but not the tail... So what these martial sects are fighting for is the personal treasure of the nameless martial arts master?"
main-3_1_11,"For some reason, the personal treasures of the nameless martial arts master were broken into several fragments. Only by collecting all the fragments can the past power of the treasure be restored."
main-3_1_12,"It's not good, a group of martial artists have surrounded our Mountain Entrance!"
main-3_1_13,What are these people surrounding the Mountain Entrance for?
main-3_1_14,They are clamoring for us to hand over the newly acquired treasure fragments.
main-3_1_15,Such audacity! They are blatantly disrespecting our sect!
main-3a_name,Mountain Entrance Disturbance
main-3a_log,A group of vagabonds are eyeing the treasure fragments in your possession. Send some people to deal with them.
main-3a_1_1,Who dares to cause trouble here?
main-3a_1_2,"Hand over the fragments, or we will show no mercy!"
main-3a_1_3,"Oh, don't be so aggressive."
main-3a_1_4,"You should say, we are very honored, unnamed hero. Since your sect has obtained the fragments of the unnamed hero's treasure, could you lend it to us for a few days?"
main-3a_1_6,Borrow? Aren't you here to rob us?
main-3a_1_7,"The unnamed hero's treasure belongs to everyone in the martial arts world, how can you monopolize it?"
main-3a_1_8,Let's see who's better in a real fight!
main-3a_2_1,"This place is too tough, let's try another sect!"
main-3a_2_2,"No matter how good the unnamed hero's treasure is, you have to be alive to enjoy it."
main-3a_2_3,"We are not as skilled as you, we will come back another day to learn from you!"
main-3a_2_4,These vagabonds disappeared in the blink of an eye when they realized they were no match.
main-3a_2_5,"These martial arts losers are not very good, but they sure can run fast."
main-3a_2_6,"Innocence is honorable, but possession of the jade is a crime. Keeping this fragment is a blessing or a curse."
main-3a_3_1,"Told you, you don't have the strength to keep the treasure, now do you believe it?"
main-3a_3_2,"Pfft, I thought you were something special!"
main-3a_3_3,Let's finish them off once and for all.
main-3a_3_4,"Total Annihilation, to avoid future troubles!"
main-3a_3_5,"Failed to succeed, it's hard to escape fate, didn't expect to fall into the hands of these petty thieves.\nI can't accept this——"
main-3b_1_1,"I heard there's a storyteller in the martial arts world, telling the story of the unnamed hero, why not go and listen..."
main-3b_name,Martial Arts Storyteller
main-3b_log,"There's a storyteller somewhere telling the story of the unnamed hero, you might be able to get the information you need."
main-3b_2_1,"Ladies and gentlemen, today I'm going to tell you about a mysterious but upright hero!"
main-3b_2_2,"Years ago, the Zhao Kingdom was in turmoil, both internally and externally,\nExternally, there was the menacing Yan Yun Iron Army,\nInternally, there was constant party strife, and the people were living in misery,\nAt this critical juncture of national crisis,\nA hero emerged to save the day!"
main-3b_2_3,"He single-handedly broke into the Yan army camp,\nCaptured the enemy chief Wanyan Wuzhu, and lifted the siege of Chuxiang City.\nThis forced the enemy to retreat, unable to invade the Central Plains again!"
main-3b_2_4,"Just as the foreign enemies retreated, the Zhao court stirred up trouble again,\nDuke Qi, Duke Kang, and the Chai King faction instigated internal strife among the martial arts forces, taking advantage of the situation to vie for the throne."
main-3b_2_5,"All kinds of conspiracies and tricks were thwarted by the unnamed hero,\nThis hero became a thorn in the side of the princes.\nThe Imperial City Department mobilized all its forces, joined by the palace masters and various forces,\nThey set up a No Escape trap, intending to annihilate the unnamed hero in one fell swoop.\nHowever, after this battle, not only was Tong Daofu missing,\nThe Imperial City Department was completely wiped out and completely discredited!"
main-3b_2_6,"About this hero, no one knows his identity or the origin of his martial arts, we only know that he calls himself..."
main-3b_2_7,Unnamed...
main-3b_2_8,"Later, this unnamed hero, for some reason, suddenly disappeared without a trace."
main-3b_2_9,"Although he disappeared, the three treasures that accompanied him through the world are still circulating in the martial arts world for some reason."
main-3b_2_10,What are the three treasures?
main-3b_2_11,"This young man will keep you in suspense for now, today's story ends here. If you want to know what happens next, please stay tuned for the next episode!"
main-3b_2_12,"Just when it gets to the most critical part, he leaves us hanging... Let's come back for the next story."
main-3c_1_1,"That Shuo Shuren has appeared again, let's go and listen to what strange tales he has to tell this time."
main-3c_name,Martial Arts Storyteller
main-3c_log,"There's a storyteller somewhere telling the story of the unnamed hero, you might be able to get the information you need."
main-3c_2_1,"In the last story, this nameless hero mysteriously disappeared after accomplishing an extraordinary feat, leaving no trace."
main-3c_2_2,"Although he disappeared, the three treasures that accompanied him throughout his adventures are still circulating in the martial arts world."
main-3c_2_3,"The first one is his protected treasure A, named ""Fubuki"".\nIt is impervious to swords and spears, and no ordinary means can harm it."
main-3c_2_4,"The second one is his personal ring, named ""Shinsai"".\nMade of thousand-year-old jade, it has extraordinary effects and can double the efficiency of martial arts training when worn."
main-3c_2_5,"The last one is his favorite weapon, named ""Secret Battle Box"".\nIt is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, containing machinery that can be freely assembled into a hundred different weapons to fight enemies."
main-3c_2_6,"Unfortunately, after a long struggle, each treasure was divided into three fragments by people."
main-3c_2_7,"It is said that nine sects in the martial arts world each hold a piece.\nBut which sects hold them is a secret of the martial arts world, and I don't know."
main-3c_2_8,"The world is bustling, all for profit.\nThe world is in turmoil, all for profit."
main-3c_2_9,"Ladies and gentlemen, words alone are not enough, let's follow this young man to see how this chaotic martial arts world will develop."
main-3c_2_10,Fubuki... Shinsai... Secret Battle Box...
main-3c_2_11,Whoever can get these personal treasures of a martial arts legend will naturally have an extra chance of winning in the competition for the position of Jianghu Master...
main-3d_1_1,"To this day, two fragments have fallen into our {MyFaction} hands."
main-3d_1_2,"Although the progress is smooth, there are also many sects that have greatly swallowed other sects, and their strength is far above ours. It is difficult to predict the outcome of a head-on confrontation..."
main-3d_1_3,The usual methods are unlikely to significantly increase the strength of our sect in a short period of time.
main-3d_1_4,"It seems that the only way is to search for and collect the fragments of the nameless hero's treasures like them, and pin our hopes on repairing the treasures."
main-3d_1_5,"The two pieces we currently hold are fragments of the Fubuki treasure A. As long as we snatch another piece from other sects, we can find a blacksmith to recast it!"
main-3e_1_1,"Recently, someone has repeatedly attacked our properties, causing huge losses, and many disciples have been injured."
main-3e_1_2,"What a bunch of cowards who dare not show their faces, they don't dare to attack our mountain entrance, they only vent their anger on the disciples."
main-3e_1_3,"It is estimated that it is the remnants of the sects we conquered before causing trouble, send some people to deal with them."
main-3e_name,Revenge of the Remnants
main-3e_log,"Although you have conquered many sects, there are still some remnants who bear grudges and seek revenge, wearing night clothes and causing destruction everywhere."
main-3e_2_1,Stop!
main-3e_2_2,"Who are you, daring to commit atrocities and sabotage in secret!"
main-3e_2_3,"You {MyFaction} forced our sect leader to submit with your superior martial arts, it's time to pay the price!"
main-3e_2_4,"You even claim to restore the order of the martial arts world, what a joke."
main-3e_2_5,You dare to show off your eloquence without even revealing your true identity? Take this!
main-3e_3_1,"You are so weak, next time you want revenge, bring some more powerful helpers!"
main-3e_4_1,Uh... I didn't expect that we are not as skilled...
main-3e_4_2,Die!
main-3e_4_3,"Don't linger in battle, their reinforcements will arrive on Horse soon, we have achieved our goal, retreat first."
main-3e_4_4,You're lucky!
main-4_1_1,"Finally gathered three pieces of the treasure, it's time to find Blacksmith to restore the treasure and bring back its former glory."
main-4_1_2,Was the restoration successful?
main-4_1_3,"It's indeed the personal treasure of the nameless hero, truly a masterpiece.\nI've tried thirteen different methods, but still failed..."
main-4_1_4,"My skills are not refined enough, it seems I can't satisfy you."
main-4_1_5,Is there another solution?
main-4_1_6,"Have you ever heard of the ""Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman""?"
main-4_1_7,"""Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman""? I've never heard of it."
main-4_1_8,"He is my senior brother, although he is eccentric, he specializes in the method of restoring objects."
main-4_1_9,"To be honest, the three most expensive antiques in the world were successfully restored by him. If he can't restore this object, I'm afraid no one else can."
main-4_1_10,Oh? How can I find this person?
main-4_1_11,"I heard that after his wife passed away, he secluded himself in a deep mountain forest. I'll draw you a map."
main-4_1_12,"With the map in hand, the next step is to invite him out of the mountain."
main-4b_name,Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman
main-4b_log,"Ordinary Blacksmiths can't restore the treasure pieces in your hand, you can only invite the mysterious Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman out of the mountain."
main-4b_1_1,You and a few others followed the map and finally found the secluded place of the Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman.
main-4b_1_2,"Old Man, do you know where the Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman lives?"
main-4b_1_3,What turtle? What sauce? I don't know.
main-4b_1_4,"We're looking for an old predecessor who specializes in restoring objects, have you heard of him?"
main-4b_1_5,"I haven't heard of it, go away, don't disturb my rest."
main-4b_1_6,"There are many poisonous insects and fierce beasts in the deep mountain forest, why are you so leisurely, Old Man?"
main-4b_1_7,"I'm brave, not afraid!"
main-4b_1_8,Then why are your hands full of calluses and your eyes bright?
main-4b_1_9,I got it from farming.
main-4b_1_10,Where is your field?
main-4b_1_11,Why should I tell you about my land?
main-4b_1_12,"What a pity, we were originally looking for him to restore the treasure pieces of the nameless hero.\nSince we can't find the person, let's forget it."
main-4b_1_14,"Let's go, we'll find someone else!"
main-4b_1_15,Hold on!
main-4b_1_16,"Hmm? Old Man, do you have anything else?"
main-4b_1_17,Take a good look! I am the person you are looking for!
main-4b_1_18,"You just keep farming, we don't lack food."
main-4b_1_19,……
main-4b_1_20,What a provocation!
main-4b_1_21,Forget it! I'll go back with you.
main-4b_1_22,"The nameless hero has been kind to me, I can't refuse to restore his treasure.\nBut you have to promise me, once I start repairing, you absolutely can't find someone else."
main-4b_1_24,Deal!
main-4b_1_25,"You returned to the sect, the Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman looked at the three pieces with great excitement"
main-4b_1_26,"It's the real Fubuki!\nThis treasure is invincible to weapons and leaves no trace of blood, today I finally see it."
main-4b_1_28,"Leave the rest to me~ But let me tell you in advance, restoring such a treasure is exhausting and takes three months to properly repair, don't rush me!"
main-4b_1_30,"Of course, thank you, Master Ghost Hand."
main-5_1_1,Hahaha! It's done! It's done!
main-5_1_2,"I've done you such a big favor, if you get the other six pieces in the future, you must give them to me!"
main-5_1_3,"Of course, besides you, we can't find a second person who is a master craftsman."
main-5_1_4,"One of the three treasures has been obtained, I wonder which sect holds the pieces of the other two."
main-5_1_5,"There's a swordsman outside the door who wants to challenge our sect, he says..."
main-5_1_6,"He said that he was spared by us last time, and after mastering the Challenging Fate skill, he came to teach us a lesson."
main-5_1_7,"Perfect timing, let's test the power of this treasure!"
main-5_name,Main storyline.
main-5_log,Send disciples to deal with the swordsman.
main-5a_name,Challenge at the door.
main-5a_log,"A mysterious swordsman challenges at the door, claiming to fight to the death with the strongest in the sect."
main-5a_1_1,"I am not what I used to be, and I came to request!"
main-5a_1_2,"You're persistent, it seems I have to beat you until you give up!"
main-5a_1_3,"Hand over the treasure, or I won't let it go!"
main-5a_1_4,Let's see how much you can do!
main-5a_2_1,"Do you admit defeat? If not, let's fight again!"
main-5a_2_2,I admit defeat... I admit it... I'm not your opponent.
main-5a_2_3,"There will be more vagabonds coming for the treasure in the future, you better pray for luck."
main-5a_2_4,"Let the soldiers block, it's a good opportunity to test my martial arts!"
main-5a_4_1,I didn't expect you to become so strong...
main-5a_4_2,"Treasure, only those with strength deserve it, you don't!"
main-5a_4_3,"With the treasure being stolen, your sect fell into decline and was soon lost in the dust of history."
main-5c_1_1,"I am the master of Sky Breaker Tower, here to visit the head of {MyFaction}."
main-5c_1_2,Sky Breaker Tower?
main-5c_1_3,"Sky Breaker Tower is a hidden treasure tower in the martial arts world, with twelve floors in total."
main-5c_1_4,"Each floor is guarded by a hermit from the martial arts world, defeating them can earn rich rewards."
main-5c_1_5,"If you beat the highest twelfth floor, you will get an incredibly powerful mysterious feature."
main-5c_1_6,"Unfortunately, in the past hundred years, only the nameless hero has reached the twelfth floor."
main-5c_1_7,"When he came to Sky Breaker Tower, he was just a nobody in the martial arts world. I thought he would back down, but he didn't expect him to break through all twelve floors in one breath."
main-5c_1_8,"Now, your sect, which has obtained the treasure of the nameless hero, may be able to reproduce his past glory. Sky Breaker Tower opens every 6 months, and there will be guides to guide your disciples."
main-5c_1_9,"I look forward to the good news of your sect's successful challenge, goodbye!"
main-5c_1_10,Nameless hero... Sky Breaker Tower...
main-5c_1_11,Send someone to check it out then.
main-5d_1_1,What changes have there been in the martial arts world under this recent offensive?
main-5d_1_2,Several sects have already agreed with our ideas and vowed to serve and no longer participate in disputes.
main-5d_1_3,"Good, our hard work and perseverance have paid off."
main-5d_1_4,"But last night, someone used a throwing knife to pin a letter to the entrance of our mountain, the words in the letter were almost a warning."
main-5d_1_5,"Oh? It seems that our actions have caused dissatisfaction among many sects, bring it to me."
main-5d_1_6,"""Your sect has conquered many sects, showing superior strength and superb martial arts. But please remember, greed is not good, if your sect insists on expanding, it may become a thing of the past, and it will be too late to regret..."""
main-5d_1_7,"Interesting, very interesting indeed!"
main-5d_1_8,"They can't think that a simple warning letter can stop us from unifying the martial arts world and rebuilding the martial arts order, can they?"
main-5d_1_9,I wonder which sect wrote it?
main-5d_1_10,"No need to know, if they really have the strength to compete with us, they wouldn't do such sneaky things."
main-6_1_1,The fragments of the second treasure have finally been collected.
main-6_1_2,I'm a bit worried...
main-6_1_3,What are you worried about?
main-6_1_4,"Worried that if we synthesize the second treasure, it will bring bigger trouble."
main-6_1_5,"After the first one was synthesized, many Vagabonds came to challenge, and there was that warning letter before. Now we are going to synthesize the second one, we should face stronger resistance..."
main-6_1_7,"It's not unreasonable to say that, should we synthesize it now?"
main-6_op_1_1,"There's nothing to be afraid of, we can deal with whatever comes."
main-6_op_1_2,It's not time for the second treasure to come out yet.
main-6_2_1,"There's nothing to be afraid of, go find the Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman quickly."
main-6_2_2,"Yes, sir!"
main-6_3_1,"You make sense, it's not the best time for the second treasure to appear."
main-6_3_2,We still need Hidden Talent to further expand our strength.
main6-a_1_1,It's really a Heart Zhai!
main6-a_1_2,"This ring is spiritual and restrained, it nourishes the body and heart, and I finally see it today."
main6-a_1_3,"Leave the rest to me, I need three months to repair!"
main6-a_name,Main Quest
main6-a_log,Wait for the second treasure to be repaired.
main6-b_name,Repair the treasure
main6-b_log,Send someone to find the Ghost Hand Divine Craftsman to repair the second treasure.
main-7_1_1,"The second treasure has finally been successfully repaired, hahaha!"
main-7_1_2,"There are three pieces left for the last one, bring them to me quickly!"
main-7_1_3,Why do I feel that you are more anxious about repairing the treasure than we are...
main-7_1_4,"Humph, it's such a treasure, it's natural to be anxious."
main-7_1_5,"Now that we have two of the three treasures, the plan to rebuild the martial arts order and eliminate the disputes in the rivers and lakes is just one step away."
main-7_1_6,Hmm? What's making you so panicked?
main-7_1_7,I... I just got a message from Cicada...
main-7_1_8,"What news, don't worry, take your time."
main-7_1_9,"Before the disappearance of the Nameless Hero, he put all his Martial Arts treasures in a treasure house."
main-7_1_10,"As long as the treasure house is opened, you can get the inheritance of this martial arts myth and become the supreme martial arts."
main-7_1_11,"If this news is true, I'm afraid this treasure house can't be easily opened, right?"
main-7_1_12,"Yes, the entrance of the treasure house is sealed by a mysterious iron door, which is extremely hard and cannot be destroyed by external force."
main-7_1_13,"According to rumors, the three personal treasures of the Nameless Hero are the keys to open this treasure house."
main-7_1_14,Could it be that these three treasures were deliberately released into the rivers and lakes by him?
main-7_1_15,"Anyway, we have two treasures, and we have become a thorn in the eyes of other sects. \nQuickly notify other Disciples, strengthen the sect's defense, and be ready for everything!"
main-7_1_16,"Yes, sir!"
main-8_1_1,"Someone sent another letter, but refused to reveal his identity."
main-8_1_2,"Hiding his head and tail, there must be something strange in the letter."
main-8_1_3,You open the letter and read it carefully
main-8_1_4,"The martial arts have been fighting for years, which is not a blessing for the rivers and lakes\nNow the inheritance of the Nameless Hero has appeared, and it can only be opened with three treasures\nNow we are holding a sect leader conference, sincerely inviting all sect leaders\nThe other sects have expressed their intention to unite and cooperate, only your sect's opinion is missing\nHope {MyFaction} will uphold the concept of the Nameless Hero and come to the conference"
main-8_1_5,"It sounds so nice, but it's just a pressure on us to group together, hoping that we won't monopolize the treasure and become the public enemy of the rivers and lakes."
main-8_1_6,"It's so shameless... They were the ones who started the war first, and they even said they hope we will uphold the concept of the Nameless Hero!"
main-8_1_7,Are we going to this sect leader conference?
main-8_1_8,"The Nameless Hero dared to break into the Yan Army camp alone back then, what's there to fear about a sect leader conference!"
main-8_1_9,"You went alone to the venue of the Sect Leader Conference\nAs you expected,\nThe various sect leaders tried to persuade and coerce you with grand promises and threats\nBut they only wanted you to hand over those two treasures, so as not to become the enemy of the entire martial arts world"
main-8_1_10,"The martial arts world has been polluted by you, yet you have the audacity to sit on the moral high ground and criticize my sect."
main-8_1_11,"If you want to fight, then fight, if you want to hit, then hit, I, {MyFaction}, have nothing to fear!"
main-8_1_12,You are like summer insects that cannot understand ice... Excuse me for leaving!
main-8_1_13,Returning to the sect...
main-8_1_14,Various sects have declared war on us one after another...
main-8_1_15,"They spread rumors in the martial arts world, saying that {MyFaction} is a disaster to the martial arts world, calling on the martial arts community to rise up and attack us, to eliminate us for the greater good!"
main-8_1_16,"A bunch of nobodies, they are asking for humiliation.\nIf they want to fight, then we will accompany them to the end!"
main-8_1_17,"Only the last three pieces are missing, it's time to completely end this martial arts dispute!"
main-9_1_1,"After so many fierce battles, we finally got the last three pieces."
main-9_1_2,"A hundred changes in the divine machine, a hundred weapons in a box...\nIt's time for the Secret Battle Box, which has accompanied the nameless hero through the world, to make its appearance."
main-9_1_3,"Hahaha! I didn't expect you to be able to gather all nine pieces!\nAlthough this third treasure is exquisitely crafted, the effort required to repair it far exceeds the previous ones."
main-9_1_4,"But even if I, an old ghost, have to exhaust my heart and soul, even if I have to sacrifice myself, it's a happy thing!\nAs usual, come and get it in three months. I can't wait to see the three treasures together!"
main-9_1_5,"The remaining major sects are watching closely, waiting for the three treasures to appear, and there will be a bloody storm."
main-9_1_6,"Is this turbulent martial arts world, this endless dispute, finally coming to an end..."
main-10_1_1,"How is it, has the last treasure been successfully repaired?"
main-10_1_2,"The treasure has been successfully repaired, but..."
main-10_1_3,"Why did you come alone, where is Master Ghost Hand?"
main-10_1_4,"Master Ghost Hand, due to overwork, suddenly vomited several liters of blood after the Secret Battle Box was born, and passed away with a smile..."
main-10_1_5,"What? Why did Master Ghost Hand have to do this!\nDid he leave any last words?"
main-10_1_6,"At that time, Master Ghost Hand was dying, but he still smiled and said to me..."
main-10_1_7,"I, Ghost Hand, am not a good person..."
main-10_1_8,"Back then, I was arrogant and domineering, thinking I was superior because I had a special skill."
main-10_1_9,"One day, a few enemies took advantage of my absence at home and brutally assassinated my wife."
main-10_1_10,"Although I heard the news and rushed back early, it was already too late.\nNot only was my wife dead, but I was also surrounded by enemies, hanging by a thread."
main-10_1_11,"Just when I was waiting for death with my eyes closed, a young hero stepped forward.\nHe not only eliminated my wife's killer for me, but also saved my foolish life."
main-10_1_12,"He seemed to understand my feelings very well, and to comfort me, he told me his story..."
main-10_1_13,"I have lived through three lives, each one to make up for the regrets of the previous one."
main-10_1_14,"In my first life, I was just an ordinary person yearning for the martial arts world.\nWhen I first started, I wandered around the world, doing what I thought was righteous."
main-10_1_15,"When Chuxiang City was besieged by the Yan army, I rushed to try to turn the tide, but because I neglected my martial arts training, the city fell and the martial arts world was in chaos..."
main-10_1_16,"In my second life, I changed my thinking and focused on martial arts."
main-10_1_17,"Although I successfully defeated the Yan army in Chuxiang City, I neglected the cultivation of MedicalToxicology...\nLeaving me helpless when Me drank Poison wine at Ye Pengju's, watching him die unjustly!"
main-10_1_18,"In this life, I swear to make up for any regrets, eliminate any mistakes, and build an ideal perfect Jianghu."
main-10_1_19,"I originally thought that in this life I had made up for all the regrets, making the world and Jianghu the most perfect..."
main-10_1_20,"But all this is just my existence, if I am not here, where will this Jianghu go?"
main-10_1_21,"After saying that, the young knight quietly left, leaving me alone in thought, chewing on his last words..."
main-10_1_22,"If I am not here, where will this Jianghu go?"
main-10_1_23,"Inspired by him, I gave up all Fake fame and retired to the mountains... until you came to me with his relics, I had the intention to come out of the mountains again."
main-10_1_24,"The three treasures have been repaired, unnamed hero, I, Ghost Hand, am honored to fulfill my duty!"
main-10_1_25,I didn't expect that Master Ghost Hand and the unnamed hero had such a connection... it's really sad and sighing.
main-10_1_26,I've always been puzzled... what does the unnamed hero mean by going through three lives?
main-10_1_27,"Such incredible things, how can you understand, I'm afraid only in the hero's treasure trove can you know some fragments."
main-10a_name,Unnamed Hero's Treasure Trove
main-10a_log,"Your sect has gathered all the treasures, you can open the unnamed hero's treasure trove at any time to get the inheritance."
main-10a_1_1,This is the place where the unnamed hero hides his treasures.
main-10a_1_2,"Strange, why is there nothing here...\nCould it be that the so-called inheritance of the unnamed hero is a shocking lie?"
main-10a_1_3,Of course it's not a lie.
main-10a_1_4,"A Mysterious Man with extremely high agility, appeared behind you unknowingly."
main-10a_1_5,No one in the world can appear behind me silently! Who are you?
main-10a_1_6,"I have no name, you can call me... unnamed..."
main-10a_1_7,Unnamed hero! You... you're not dead!
main-10a_1_8,"Heh... If I don't want to die, who in this world can kill me?"
main-10a_1_9,What about this treasure trove and those three treasures?
main-10a_1_10,"They are my bets, I used them to bet with the whole Jianghu.\nAs for why I did that, the reason is actually very simple..."
main-10a_1_11,Because I am not from this world...
main-10a_1_12,"Perhaps because of the weakness and confusion in the past, in every life, I have left enough regrets.\nSome are not saving the people who should be saved, some are not killing all the people who should be killed..."
main-10a_1_13,"In order to make up for the regrets, I keep restarting the world, doing everything possible to prevent certain things from happening."
main-10a_1_14,"Finally, I have achieved great martial arts, and I understand all the changes in the events, and I have built an ideal Jianghu in this life."
main-10a_1_15,"But I can't help thinking, is all this change just because of my existence?\nIf I Run away from this world one day, where will the whole Jianghu go?"
main-10a_1_16,Unnamed hero...
main-10a_1_17,"To verify this, I pretended to disappear, letting the three personal treasures flow into Jianghu. Unexpectedly, the former righteous and evil factions, all fell into long-term fighting for these things."
main-10a_1_18,"Just when I was utterly disappointed and willing to admit defeat, your {MyFaction} appearance brightened my eyes!"
main-10a_1_19,"Passively entered the game, but also Defender Jianghu morality."
main-10a_1_20,"Collecting fragments, but only to reconstruct the order of the martial arts."
main-10a_1_21,"To be an enemy of the world, yet never lose the ambition to reach the sky."
main-10a_1_22,"You don't have to call me a hero.\nIn my own world, I'm just an ordinary person."
main-10a_1_23,"Now that there are successors in the martial world, I can safely run away from this world, but before that, there is one last thing I want to do..."
main-10a_1_24,"That is to have a hearty battle with {MyFaction}, who is at the peak of the martial world!"
main-10a_1_25,"Come on, give it your all, as the best gift for my departure from this world!"
main-10a_2_1,"That's more like it, seems like I underestimated you."
main-10a_2_2,"You're worth me putting in more effort. Come on, the ultimate martial arts - Multi-round Clone Technique!"
main-10a_2_3,All martial arts in the world are within my palm!
main-10a_2_4,Watch closely!
main-10a_3_1,Is this all the strength you have... It seems I overestimated you.
main-10a_3_2,But your existence proves that this martial world doesn't rely solely on me.
main-10a_3_3,I should return to my own world and pick up the life that has nothing to do with martial arts.
main-10a_3_4,"The martial world is vast, we'll meet again if fate allows!"
main-10a_4_1,"Not bad, not bad at all!"
main-10a_4_2,"Indeed, there are always new talents emerging..."
main-10a_4_3,"Since you can defeat me, you should have no problem protecting this martial world."
main-10a_4_4,I should return to my own world and pick up the life that has nothing to do with martial arts.
main-10a_4_5,"The martial world is vast, we'll meet again if fate allows!"
main-10a_5_1,"Unfortunately, you're still a bit green."
main-10a_5_2,But you've proven your skills by pushing me to this point.
main-10a_5_3,I should return to my own world and pick up the life that has nothing to do with martial arts.
main-10a_5_4,"The martial world is vast, we'll meet again if fate allows!"
main-10a_6_1,"The nameless hero disappears into the void\nLeaving only the stunned figures of the people present\nMany people speculate\nWhat kind of scenery would his world be\nWould it be more martial than the martial world, more rivers and lakes than the rivers and lakes\nUnfortunately, this secret\nIs destined to remain unknown forever"
main-10b_1_1,"Upon learning that we have inherited the legacy of the nameless hero, the existing sects finally couldn't sit still."
main-10b_1_2,They all mobilized their forces to attack our sect.
main-10b_1_3,"These mediocre people, how would they know that the legacy of the nameless hero is not a martial arts manual, but a ""struggle and belief of a person alone in the martial world""."
main-10b_1_4,"They will probably arrive in <color=#00FF00>three months</color>, it's better to prepare in advance."
main-10b_1_5,"Let them come, even the dim glow of rotten grass dares to compete with the bright moon."
main-10c_1_1,"There are already sects attacking the entrance of the mountain, and a few more will arrive soon, we need to prepare our defenses quickly!"
main-10c_1_2,"Stay calm, there's no need to panic!"
main-10c_1_3,"Ever since we {MyFaction} decided to rebuild the order of the martial world and embarked on this irreversible path, we should have been prepared to face this day."
main-10c_1_4,"Let's go, let's meet them!"

main-10d_1_1,"The headmaster, they are coming up... Since we didn't take the initiative, we are now retreating step by step in a hurry..."
main-10d_2_1,"You are late, I have been waiting for you at {MyFaction} for a long time."
main-10d_2_2,"Although you sect masters each have your own opinions, you can actually gather together. This scene is really eye-opening."
main-10d_2_3,"We, {MyFaction}, have our own moral compass, and the right and wrong of our actions are not determined by your words."
main-10d_2_4,"Enough talk, let's see what you've got!"
main-10d_3_1,"We, the Blue Wind Camp, rob from the rich to give to the poor. You are the rich, we are the poor. Hand over the treasures and we'll leave, hahaha!"
main-10d_4_1,"I didn't want to be your enemy, but I had no choice. I apologize for any offense..."
main-10d_5_1,"I came here only to see the treasure. I apologize for any offense, please forgive me."
main-10d_6_1,"The treasures of the nameless hero belong to everyone, how can you monopolize them?"
main-10d_7_1,"There are always idealists in the martial arts world, but most of them don't end well."
main-10d_8_1,"Hand over the three treasures, and we'll leave your bodies intact. How about it, isn't that a fair deal?"
main-10d_9_1,I heard that your sect has obtained the martial arts legacy of the nameless hero. I want to see how powerful it is!
main-10d_10_1,"Here's a piece of advice for your sect, making the entire martial arts world your enemy is courting destruction."
main-10d_11_1,There are always some fools who talk about your martial arts skills as if they were divine. I want to see if they can even touch a single hair of mine.
main-10d_12_1,"To this day, many sects have perished at your hands. We, the Crime Investigation Bureau, cannot stand by and do nothing!"
main-10d_13_1,"In order to restore the prestige of the Tiger Escort, I must participate in this battle. I'm sorry..."
main-10d_14_1,"I heard that the head of your sect is not only a martial arts master, but also has the true transmission of the nameless hero. I, Jian Chi, have come to learn from you."
main-10d_15_1,Sigh...
main-10d_16_1,A brother in my gang is obsessed with practicing martial arts and urgently needs to borrow a Shinsai from your sect. I hope you can help.
main-10d_17_1,"I, the sect leader, don't care about any treasures. Hand over the nameless Martial Arts heritage, and I will ensure your safety!"
main-10d_18_1,"You are going against the heavens, trying to confront the entire martial world with your own power. It's ridiculous!"
main-10d_19_1,"I, the old Taoist, approve of the philosophy of your sect.\nHowever, if you want to rebuild the order, the treasures of the nameless hero should be managed by multiple sects. Please make a sacrifice."
main-10d_20_1,"Amitabha... You are full of greed, anger, and ignorance. You should wake up as soon as possible and get out of the sea of suffering..."
main-10d_21_1,"Cherish your last breath, because you won't feel it soon!"
main-10d_22_1,"These sect elites are not only stronger than we expected, but they also cooperate tacitly, taking advantage of our disadvantage of being outnumbered and chasing us fiercely..."
main-10d_22_2,There are too many people... We can't hold on...
main-10d_22_3,"Even if we are in a desperate situation at this moment, we will fight to the last moment...\nIf not, wouldn't it be a shame to the heavy trust of the nameless hero!"
main-10d_22_4,"Seeing the situation is unfavorable, you make an effort to jump and block the Finishing Strike for many disciples\nBut after all, human power is limited, and you soon fall into the dangerous situation of being surrounded\nThe masters of all sects are coming like a tide\nEach one is of Prominence\nBefore long, the comrades behind you fell one after another,\nYou slowly close your eyes\nIn the last second of HP, you imagine the ideal martial world in your mind\nUnfortunately, these can no longer be realized"
main-10d_23_1,"All the major sects have been completely repelled by us. The current strategy should be to take advantage of their severe injuries and continue chasing, completely dominating the martial world!"
main-10d_23_2,"Rebuilding the order of the martial world, just one last step..."
main-11_1_1,"Today, the world of martial arts finally returns to peace..."
main-11_1_2,"But to completely rebuild and reform the order of the martial world, there are countless things to do."
main-11_1_3,"The various sect leaders who have submitted to Us have sent congratulatory letters, congratulating our sect on becoming the Peak of Jianghu."
main-11_1_4,"Tell them for Me, from now on, there is no such thing as the Peak of Jianghu."
main-11_1_5,What?
main-11_1_6,"Even if We have no desire for fame and fortune, having such a status makes things much easier!"
main-11_1_7,"The stability and development of the Jianghu can never rely on a strong individual or a powerful force... When the strong exist, all is calm, but if the strong disappear, the waves will roll again."
main-11_1_8,What makes Us confident to repeat the mistakes that the nameless heroes of the past failed to accomplish?
main-11_1_9,"Ever since that meeting with him in the treasury, I have been pondering how to eliminate the ills of the Jianghu and how to promote the development of the martial arts..."
main-11_1_10,"The final result, although not a great enlightenment, but I have thought of some feasible plans."
main-11_1_11,What is the plan? My mind is a bit muddled now...
main-11_1_12,"I plan to establish a martial arts association with the leaders of various sects, swearing not to keep secrets for the sake of sect prejudices, and to study Martial Arts together to promote the overall development of the martial arts."
main-11_1_13,"If there are grudges, all the leaders will serve as witnesses and enforce the law impartially. If anyone dares to act against the tide and stir up trouble, they will be attacked by all!",หากมีเรื่องค้างคาใจ ผู้นำทุกคนจะเป็นสักขีพยานและบังคับใช้กฎหมายอย่าง (ไร้ซึ่งอคติ) หากผู้ใดกล้ากระทำการขัดแย้งกระแสและก่อความวุ่นวาย พวกมันจะถูกโจมตีจากทุกฝ่าย!
main-11_1_14,"In this way, when the Old Man retires from the Jianghu, there will always be new people to take over the banner of protecting the martial arts. The interests of all sects are bound together, restraining each other, with Endless Life Force, lasting forever."
main-11_1_15,That's a great idea! I'll contact the various sects right now!
main-11_1_16,"At the newly convened martial arts conference, your speech shocked all the people in the Jianghu. Some admire your integrity, others laugh at your wild ideas. Although the responses are varied, no one opposes the establishment of the martial arts association. After the nameless hero, you have become the second martial arts legend whose name will go down in history. The Jianghu of this parallel world, under your guidance and promotion, has entered a new and unknown era."

part-2-2-2,Miss! Miss! Don't misunderstand!
part-2-2-3,"Let go of your hand! Help, there's a rogue!!!"
part-2-2-4,Stop!
part-2-2-5,"Hero, save me! This weirdo is obviously younger than me, but he keeps pestering me, saying that I am his mother..."
part-2-2-6,"No! I didn't say that the lady is my mother, I just said that the lady looks like my mother!"
part-2-2-7,"Whether it looks like or not, it's not a reason for you to pester a lady! If you don't leave, don't blame us for being rude!"
part-2-2-8,Everyone! Everyone! Please listen to me!
part-2-2-9,"Fine, I want to see how you can explain this."
part-2-2-10,"I am a painter, praised by my peers as ""Hua Chi""."
part-2-2-11,"Before I was born, my mother had passed away, so I didn't know what she looked like since I was a child. To cheer me up, my father described my mother's appearance to me over and over again."
part-2-2-12,"One day, I suddenly had an idea to draw a portrait of my mother based on these descriptions, but no matter how I drew or modified it, I always felt that something was missing."
part-2-2-13,So you want to find a woman who looks like your mother to paint against?
part-2-2-14,"However, I have already drawn the appearance of my mother in middle age and old age, only the appearance of her as a young girl is missing. And this lady, her eyebrows and eyes are somewhat similar to my mother's..."
part-2-2-15,"My father has recently fallen seriously ill, and I hope to finish this painting in time for him to see it."
part-2-2-16,"Your filial piety is commendable, but it's inappropriate for you to pester the lady like this."
part-2-2-17,What a hopeless romantic...
part-2-2-18,"Well... considering you are not a frivolous person, we..."
part-2_option1,We can offer some money to ask for the lady's help (500 Coin).
part-2_option2,We won't pursue you anymore.
part-2-3-1,"Miss, consider these 500 Coins as payment for helping {MyFaction} with laundry today. Could you please help Hua Chi complete the portrait of his mother?"
part-2-3-2,"Don't worry, we will keep an eye on him, if he really does something frivolous, we will not spare him!"
part-2-3-3,"Since it's a request from a disciple of {MyFaction}, I naturally agree."
part-2-3-4,"After painting for two shichen, Hua Chi finally put down his brush with reluctance."
part-2-3-5,What are you daydreaming about? Is the painting finished? Let me see...
part-2-3-6,Ah! Is this me? Can you give me the painting?
part-2-3-7,"I'm sorry, miss, but the painting isn't of you, and it's meant for my father to see."
part-2-3-8,"Wait! I don't want the 500 Coins anymore, can you leave the painting to me? Hey! I'll pay for it!"
part-2-3-9,"Wow, this kid runs really fast."
part-2-3-10,Two days later
part-2-3-11,Is this place {MyFaction}?
part-2-3-12,Oh? Aren't you Hua Chi from the other day? What brings you here?
part-2-3-13,"My father was very happy to see the portrait of my mother, and his condition quickly improved. After hearing the whole story, he instructed me to join your sect to repay the kindness."
part-2-3-14,Mr. Hua Chi is a great talent. His joining my {MyFaction} is truly a blessing for this place.
part-2-3-15,"Excellent! Thank you, Sect Leader!"
part-2-4-1,"Let's do this, we won't pursue your inappropriate behavior for now. But how can a maiden who hasn't left her family allow a stranger man to keep looking at her?"
part-2-4-2,"I'll help you ask clearly. If the lady clearly doesn't want to, don't pester her!"
part-2-4-3,"If the maiden clearly does not want to, don't bother her anymore!"
part-2-4-4,"Miss, let me ask you, since Hua Chi is so filial, are you willing to help him finish the painting?"
part-2-4-5,No way! This guy is too weird!
part-2-4-6,"Miss, this..."
part-2-4-7,"I have to go to work at the master's house to wash clothes today. There's a pile of clothes to wash. If I miss a shichen, I won't get paid for today! What does his filial piety have to do with me? Go away!"
part-2-4-8,"The young woman hurriedly ran away, Hua Chi sighed in disappointment, holding the blank painting and turned to run away."
part-2-5-1,"Where did the maiden go today? She didn't move away, did she?"
part-2-5-2,"This matter has been dragged on and on, and it seems to have been forgotten. But this painter might still pester other ladies..."
part-3-0-1,Today is the day when the scholars who made the list in the imperial examination gather and chat under the Saint's Stele. The sect leader can send someone to patrol.

part-3-1-3,Who is this uncivilized person?
part-3-1-4,"To answer your question, sir, none of us know him. When we arrived, he was already lying under the stele like this."

part-3-3-8,"This man... is really too reckless and disrespectful. Hmm, what are these things?"
part-3-3-9,"There are silver and herbs... This man didn't even clean up properly, leaving so many things on the ground?"

part-3-4-3,Two quarters of an hour later.
part-3-4-4,"Ah, what are you guys doing here, do you want to drink with me?"
part-3-4-5,"When you ran away, you were in a hurry and left a lot of things behind. We will return them to their rightful owner."
part-3-4-6,"You people from {MyFaction} have a lot of rules, but you are all people of principle."
part-3-4-7,"Wait, what you gave... why are there other things mixed in?"
part-3-4-8,"Oh! This is the content of the calligraphy of our academy's Dojokeeper, passed down for the disciples to learn. Please return it to us."
part-3-4-9,"Wait, this is... Ode to the Red Cliff! Do you have Ode to the Red Cliff in your library?"
part-3-4-10,Of course we do.
part-3-4-11,"So it's here, so it's here! I, Shu Kuang, wish to join your sect! I only hope that you will allow me to comprehend the true traces of the Calligraphy treasured by the sect!"
part-3-4-12,"Shu Kuang's calligraphy is indeed the Best of the Best today, a rare talent, it is beneficial for him to join our sect."
part-3-4-13,Mr. Shu Kuang's willingness to join {MyFaction} is definitely a great thing!
part-3-5-1,Then consider it as compensation for the damage you caused to our sect today!
part-3-6-1,"The elegant conversation under the Saint's Stele has ended, the sect leader does not need to send people to patrol anymore."
part-3-6-2,"I didn't have the manpower to look into this, but I guess it's fine, there will be more next year."
part-4-0-1,"Master, we have received reports from our jurisdiction that a white-haired woman and a strange piano sound were witnessed in the middle of the night, causing panic."
part-4-0-2,"Children do not speak of strange powers, this must be someone pretending to be a ghost, we need to send disciples to investigate!"
part-4_name,Midnight piano sound.
part-4_overview,"Someone witnessed a white-haired woman and a strange piano sound in the middle of the night, causing panic, we need to send disciples to investigate this matter!"
part-4-1-1,The news says that the midnight piano sound is here...
part-4-1-2,"Just ran into the Night Watchman, it should be about this time..."
part-4-1-3,"At this moment, a piano sound is heard from a house."
part-4-1-4,"It's here, let's go check it out!"
part-4-1-5,"You just used Qinggong to approach that house, and someone has already fled from the house."
part-4-1-6,……
part-4-1-7,"As expected, it's a white-haired woman just like the rumors."
part-4-1-8,"The white-haired woman remained silent, plucking the strings, using Music to coerce your minds."
part-4-1-9,"Damn it, her piano sound is not good, fight her!"
part-4-2-1,……！
part-4-2-2,"The white-haired woman sat on the ground, sweating profusely."
part-4-2-3,"Hey, we didn't hurt you that much, stop pretending!"
part-4-2-4,"No, something's wrong with her, it doesn't look like she's pretending."
part-4-2-5,It looks like a serious internal injury.
part-4-2-6,Should we use our skills to help her heal?
part-4-2-7,"None of us three have the ability to heal others, will it be worse if we forcefully use our skills?"
part-4-option1,Please ask the sect doctor to save her with herbs (1000Herb)
part-4-option2,Spend a lot of money to ask the city doctor to save her (1500Coin)
part-4-option3,Forcefully save her regardless of the risk
part-4-3-1,Go and ask the sect doctor to save her quickly!
part-4-3-2,"Half a moment later, the sect doctor arrived, he sat down and diagnosed..."
part-4-3-3,"She has chronic Internal Injury, affecting her five internal organs and six hollow organs. She needs long-term conditioning with Herb..."
part-4-3-4,Can she be cured?
part-4-3-5,"It's impossible to cure completely, other methods are needed. Moreover, she can't fight with others in anger in the future, otherwise the old injury will recur."
part-4-3-6,"I wonder if this white-haired girl is willing to join our sect, practice self-cultivation and health-preserving methods, and treat her illness?"
part-4-3-7,"She reluctantly nodded, pointed at herself, and wrote the two characters ""Ya Qin"" in the air."
part-4-3-8,"So your name is Ya Qin, isn't it? Can you stand up and walk by yourself now?"
part-4-3-9,She picked up the zither and silently followed the doctor.
part-4-4-1,Quickly spend a lot of money to invite a doctor from the city to treat her!
part-4-4-2,"Half a moment later, the city doctor arrived, he sat down and began to diagnose and treat..."
part-4-4-3,"She has chronic Internal Injury, affecting her five internal organs and six hollow organs. She needs long-term conditioning with Herb..."
part-4-4-4,Can she be cured?
part-4-4-5,"It's impossible to cure completely, other methods are needed. Moreover, she can't fight with others in anger in the future, otherwise the old injury will recur."
part-4-4-6,"And it requires Herb for a long time to condition, I will prepare these for you tomorrow, but the price is not cheap..."
part-4-4-7,These expenses will naturally be borne by our sect.
part-4-4-8,"Miss, do you have a quiet place to recuperate?"
part-4-4-9,She pointed at you
part-4-4-10,"Do you mean, go to {MyFaction}?"
part-4-4-11,She nodded
part-4-4-12,"Just now I fought with this woman, her Musical skill is extraordinary, if she practices our self-cultivation and nourishing nature, it would be a strong force."
part-4-4-13,"We {MyFaction} do have a good place for the girl to recuperate. If the girl is willing to go, our library is willing to welcome her."
part-4-4-14,"She reluctantly nodded, pointed at herself, and wrote the two characters ""Ya Qin"" in the air."
part-4-4-15,"So your name is Ya Qin, isn't it? Can you stand up and walk by yourself now?"
part-4-4-16,She picked up the zither and silently followed you.
part-4-5-1,I'll use my internal strength to heal her injuries!
part-4-5-2,"She has a serious Internal Injury, but I can't find the cause, I can only temporarily seal her heart meridian to save her life."
part-4-5-3,"Her face gradually improved, but her brows were still furrowed."
part-4-5-4,This is all I can do.
part-4-5-5,Let's run away from here and let her rest well.
part-4-5-6,"Alas, I just hope she won't play the zither in the middle of the night and disturb the people."
part-4-5-7,"A few days later, you visited this house again and found that it was already empty."
part-4-6-1,"Report to the sect leader, the midnight zither sound has disappeared."
part-4-6-2,"It seems that the person who is pretending to be a ghost has quieted down, so let's ignore this matter."
part-5-0-1,"Master, La Tazhang, who has been out for several months, has returned, but now he..."
part-5-0-2,What happened to him?
part-5-0-3,"He is now sleeping on a stone at the foot of the mountain, and no matter how much we call him, he won't wake up."
part-5-0-4,This La Tazhang... I'll send someone to invite him.
part-5_name,Adventurous Drunkard
part-5_overview1,"La Tazhang, who has been out for several months, has returned, but he is wandering outside the city and not going up the mountain, perhaps someone needs to be sent down the mountain to find him."
part-5-1-1,"Finally found you, come up the mountain with me quickly!"
part-5-1-2,"I'm not drunk, brother, let's drink more, drink more!"
part-5-1-3,"He's dead drunk, why don't we carry him back?"
part-5-1-4,"What are you doing? Want to wrestle with me? Come on, no problem at all!"
part-5_option1,Let's spend some money to take him to the restaurant for a drink?
part-5_option2,Then we will risk our lives to wrestle with the Honorable!
part-5-2-1,You took La Tazhang to a tavern in the city and let him drink to his heart's content.
part-5-2-2,"When he was completely drunk and fell asleep, you helped him back. His body was surprisingly lighter than before."
part-5-3-1,"Not bad! I, the Taoist priest, also want to stretch my muscles today!"
part-5-4-1,"Not bad, not bad. I've been wandering outside for so long, I don't even know what's happening on the mountain now?"
part-5-4-2,"Alright, I, the Taoist priest, am going home today!"
part-5-5-1,"Boring, boring."
part-5-5-2,"Stop bothering me, let me sleep a little longer."
part-5-5-3,La Tazhang's skills are really impressive...
part-5-5-4,"I really don't know what to do, maybe next time I'll have to invite someone even more powerful."
part-5-6-1,"Report to the sect leader, after La Tazhang woke up and went to drink again, he sighed three times and didn't know where he went."
part-5-6-2,"I actually forgot about him... Well, let him be."
part-6-0-1,"Master, the Luotian Grand Ceremony will be held soon to pray for the people. The master can send someone to patrol the preparation site."
part-6-0-2,"The Luotian Grand Ceremony is not a trivial matter, it needs to be taken seriously."
part-6_name,Luotian Grand Ceremony
part-6_overview,{MyFaction} is holding a Luotian Dajiao recently to pray for the people. The sect leader can send people to patrol the event site.
part-6-1-1,"There are 1200 places for the Dajiao, and various Appliance ritual vessels. All of these must be counted clearly!"
part-6-1-2,We are checking for the second time.
part-6-1-3,"No, no, the ceremonial positions here are wrong, and the order of the rituals is also wrong."
part-6-1-4,"You are not from my sect, who are you? Why are you here to interfere?"
part-6-1-5,"Shut up! Instead of checking the mistakes pointed out by others, you are asking about their identity."
part-6-1-6,Go and see if what this Taoist friend said is correct!
part-6-1-7,"Uh, yes!"
part-6-1-8,A few moments later.
part-6-1-9,"Ah, it's indeed wrong, I'll change it back right away."
part-6-1-10,"Wait, who is in charge of this part?"
part-6-1-11,This part... was in charge by Uncle La Tazhang before he went down the mountain.
part-6-1-12,"Uh... no wonder, it seems this was inevitable."
part-6-1-13,This Taoist friend has an extraordinary temperament and is knowledgeable. I wonder where you are from and what is your Taoist name?
part-6-1-14,"I, Chang Chunzi, have seen the Taoist friends of {MyFaction}."
part-6-1-15,"I am just a wandering Taoist. I heard that your sect is going to hold a Luotian Dajiao, so I came to observe the ceremony."
part-6-1-16,Since you are so professional...
part-6-option1,I would like to invite you to help me host the Luo Tian Grand Ceremony (1500Coin)
part-6-option2,"Thank you for your guidance. The Luotian Grand Ceremony is about to start, please feel free to do so."
part-6-2-1,Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I also hope that our country can hold a grand Luotian Grand Ceremony to pray for the people.
part-6-2-2,I just walked around and found that some items for the Luotian Grand Ceremony are not yet ready and need to be purchased and prepared down the mountain.
part-6-2-3,"Sure, since it's for the Luotian Grand Ceremony, the expenses for you to go down the mountain to handle affairs will be covered by our sect."
part-6-2-4,That's the best.
part-6-2-5,"Under the meticulous preparation and supervision of Chang Chunzi, the Luotian Grand Ceremony was very successful without any mistakes."
part-6-2-6,"After the Luo Tian Grand Ceremony, you sent an invitation to join the sect to Chang Chunzi, who gladly accepted."
part-6-3-1,"Thank you, friend. I will find a place to watch the ceremony, no need to worry."
part-6-3-2,"The Luo Tian Grand Ceremony was held as scheduled, but there were many mishaps during the process."
part-6-4-1,"Master, the Luo Tian Grand Ceremony has been held, but there were many mishaps."
part-6-4-2,"I neglected this matter, but I guess it's not a big problem."
part-7-0-1,There is a village under your jurisdiction that has been hit by a plague. The situation is serious. Please send someone to quell the plague as soon as possible.
part-7-0-2,This is no small matter... I will arrange for someone to handle it.
part-7_name,Plague Disaster
part-7_overview,A village has been hit by a plague. The situation is serious. Someone from {MyFaction} should be sent to quell the plague as soon as possible.
part-7-1-1,"You arrived at the place where the plague is rampant. The villagers are sick and bedridden, and the village is desolate."
part-7-1-2,"Young man, I heard that the plague here makes people too weak to get out of bed, why are there still people going out?"
part-7-1-3,"Master, we have a ""living immortal"" with Healing Hands here. He started researching the plague as soon as he arrived and has already saved many people."
part-7-1-4,"There's a ""living immortal""? Take us to see him. I am a disciple of {MyFaction}, maybe I can help."
part-7-1-5,"Look, the house in front is... Ah? Why is it all fenced up?"
part-7-1-6,"Chen Niwan, don't slander me!"
part-7-1-7,"I have already investigated clearly, the problem in this village is your doing!"
part-7-1-8,"Fellow villagers! I have worked hard for this village, lost my appetite, and put in a lot of effort, only to be slandered by such people. Fellow villagers, help me judge!"
part-7-1-9,"The villagers are talking about it, pointing at this Niwan Spiritual master."
part-7-1-10,"We are disciples of {MyFaction}, what's going on here?"
part-7-1-11,"{MyFaction}? Perfect timing. I am Cui Xu Zi, a doctor who travels around. The people call me the Mud Pill Spiritual Master."
part-7-1-12,"I heard about the plague here and rushed over day and night, only to unexpectedly find that this villain poisoned the water source, poisoning the whole village!"
part-7-1-13,"This person only appeared after the plague caused panic among the villagers, pretending to be a doctor and taking advantage of the villagers' remaining money and food. His intentions are evil and he deserves to be punished!"
part-7-1-14,"You're slandering me, what evidence do you have?"
part-7-1-15,"Let a disciple of {MyFaction} come with me to the water source as a witness. If you are confident that you didn't do it, you can come along!"
part-7-1-16,"What a joke, I... I'm not afraid, let's go!"
part-7-1-17,"Just a few steps after Niwan Spiritual master and you, this ""living immortal"" actually launched a sneak attack!"
part-7-1-18,"Hmph, if I hadn't been prepared, I might have fallen for it!"
part-7-1-19,"I, I just..."
part-7-1-20,"I was initially unsure of who was right or wrong between you two, but since you've made your move, it seems that what the Spiritual Master of Mud Pill said is true. Surrender, thief!"
part-7-2-1,Spare me... spare me! I was blinded by greed!
part-7-2-2,"How dare you, a thief, compare yourself to a ""living immortal"", poisoning the villagers, deceiving the world, and stealing names. Come with me to the sect!"
part-7-2-3,"Thank you, Spiritual Master, for revealing the true face of this thief. Otherwise, even we might have been deceived by him."
part-7-2-4,This is what we should do. I need to stay here and completely solve the plague.
part-7-2-5,"After we take this villain away, we will come back to help the Spiritual Master quell the plague."
part-7-2-6,"After taking the ""living immortal"" up the mountain, you quickly returned to the plague-stricken village to help the Mud Pill Spiritual Master treat the sick."
part-7-2-7,"The Mud Pill Spiritual Master's medical skills are superb. After working tirelessly for nearly a month, the plague in the village was basically eradicated and the villagers' lives began to return to normal."
part-7-2-8,"Mud Pill Spiritual Master, I have a request."
part-7-2-9,"You want me to join your sect, don't you?"
part-7-2-10,{MyFaction} is willing to work for the sick and poor without asking for anything in return. Punishing the evil and giving the people a peaceful life is what we should do.
part-7-2-11,"Besides, your sect has many pill recipes archived. Joining your sect is also my wish."
part-7-3-1,"Hmph, a bunch of ignorant youngsters, daring to ruin my good deeds!"
part-7-3-2,"Although he was defeated by this ""living immortal"", his true face was exposed and he could no longer deceive others. He had to use his lightness skills to take the money and run away from the village."
part-7-3-3,"After the Mud Pill Spiritual Master healed your injuries, he threw himself into the busy work of treating the sick and saving people in the village."
part-7-3-4,"Because they had been deceived once, the villagers were wary and suspicious of the Mud Pill Spiritual Master, which also caused some obstacles to the rescue work."
part-7-3-5,"After you recovered, you began to help the Mud Pill Spiritual Master treat the sick and save people."
part-7-3-6,"Mud Pill Spiritual Master, I have a request."
part-7-3-7,"You want me to join your sect, don't you?"
part-7-3-8,Um... yes.
part-7-3-9,People of {MyFaction} are willing to work for the sick and poor without asking for anything in return. Punishing the evil and giving the people a peaceful life is what we should do.
part-7-3-10,"Besides, your sect has many pill recipes archived. Joining your sect is also my wish."
part-7-4-1,"Master, the plague in the village has been eradicated. It is said that it was cured by a ""living immortal"" doctor."
part-7-4-2,I forgot about this... But I'm relieved that someone is handling it.
part-8-0-1,"Leader, there's someone claiming to be an old acquaintance of yours asking to see you, with a special identity..."
part-8-0-2,"An old acquaintance? I wonder who it could be... I understand, I'll arrange it."
part-8_name,An old acquaintance is visiting
part-8_overview,"An old acquaintance is asking to see you, with a special identity... It's best for the leader to see him."
part-8-1-1,"I was wondering who it was, turns out it's Zhan Xiongfei, the guard. What brings you here?"
part-8-1-2,"If you want to buy treasures, bid for it. Case interrogation, before this. Chat over tea, after this."
part-8-1-3,It seems Brother Shen still remembers the last incident.
part-8-1-4,You seem to have brought up something I don't want to remember.
part-8-1-5,"I came here this time indeed with a request, I came to {MyFaction} to ask for a position."
part-8-1-6,Brother Zhan... Were you dismissed?
part-8-1-7,"No, I'll be straightforward. I trust Brother Shen, so I'll state my purpose directly."
part-8-1-8,"A major theft occurred in Daliang City, I was ordered to investigate, and everyone knows that all kinds of rare treasures often appear and circulate in {MyFaction}, so I want to stay here permanently to look for clues."
part-8-1-9,"Brother Shen, give me a position, so that I can act conveniently."
part-8-1-10,"Of course, I won't cause trouble for Brother Shen. I came here prepared to change my identity and be driven by Brother Shen."
part-8-1-11,Until the clues are found?
part-8-1-12,Until the clues are found.
part-8-1-13,"Why not go to Glittering Artifact Auction, or Dirty Street to have a look, aren't there auctions there too?", ทำไมไม่ไปดูที่งานประมูลสินค้าหอไข่มุก หรือว่าที่ตรอกเล้าหมูนั่นก็จัดงานประมูลเหมือนกันไม่ใช่เหรอ?
part-8-1-14,"We naturally have colleagues going there to investigate. It's just that I have an old relationship with Brother Shen, and my reputation... is really inconvenient."
part-8-1-15,Let me think for a moment...
part-8_option1,"Good, Brother Zhan, welcome to {MyFaction}."
part-8_option2,{MyFaction} is too small to accommodate a hero like Brother Zhan.
part-8-2-1,"Brother Zhan's strength is outstanding, which is helpful to {MyFaction}. But there are two points to make clear."
part-8-2-2,"Brother Shen, please speak, I will follow."
part-8-2-3,"First, don't make the investigation public. Second, don't interfere with the auction, even if the suspect is confirmed, take action after the auction is over, far away from {MyFaction}."
part-8-2-4,All these can be agreed upon.
part-8-2-5,"Third, for the items I personally want to sell, I would like Brother Zhan to help raise the price secretly..."
part-8-2-6,Well... it depends on the situation.
part-8-3-1,"Forget it, forget it. But Brother Shen, I still have to make it clear."
part-8-3-2,"I still need to continue investigating in {MyFaction}, but without the help of Brother Shen, I can't do anything conveniently."
part-8-3-3,"Brother Shen, see you later."
part-8-4-1,"Leader, your old acquaintance said he couldn't wait any longer and left first, he will come to visit again later."
part-8-4-2,"The Soul Departure Syndrome is acting up again... sigh. I don't know who that old acquaintance is, I can only wait for him to visit again."
part-9-0-1,"What's wrong, why is the discipline of today's morning class so bad?"
part-9-0-2,You're here! You come and manage this mad monk who ran back!
part-9-0-3,"What's the panic, where's your cultivation?"
part-9-0-4,"This mad monk, hard to clean, ragged, emitting a foul smell. The novice monks who do morning classes have not reached the state of not being affected by the five senses, many people can't concentrate."
part-9-0-5,"Moreover, he can't stand sitting meditation, doesn't like chanting, and starts sleeping on the spot less than half a moment into the morning class. What's worse, he even drinks and eats meat in public, disregarding the precepts."
part-9-0-6,Where is this person now?
part-9-0-7,"Uh... he was just here, he must have run out of the temple on his own!"
part-9-0-8,It seems I need to send some people out to find him.
part-9_name,Mad Monk Leaves the Temple
part-9_overview,"The new monk is really outrageous, please send someone to check it out."
part-9-1-1,"You left {MyFaction}, because this mad monk is too conspicuous, there are many witnesses along the way."
part-9-1-2,"You mean the monk with ragged clothes and patches, and a stinky smell? He ran in that direction!"
part-9-1-3,"That monk who drinks and eats meat, he just carried a crying girl this way!"
part-9-1-4,"Are you talking about that high monk? He helped a girl who was captured by Mountain Bandit find her parents, he's such a good person!"
part-9-1-5,That monk uncle gave us a lot of big white steamed buns to eat... several people have been eating until they vomit and still eating.
part-9-1-6,He woke up my mother! He's a living Buddha!
part-9-1-7,It seems that this mad monk has been doing good deeds all the way.
part-9-1-8,"We've been chasing him all the way, and he's been running so fast, yet still has time to do good deeds. Isn't his Qinggong a bit outrageous..."
part-9-1-9,"Wait, look! There seems to be a strong man taking a shortcut ahead!"
part-9-1-10,"You bald donkey, you actually stole our mountain stronghold's food!"
part-9-1-11,"Stinky monk, that's what I worked hard to rob and steal from the mountain!"
part-9-1-12,"You actually gave it all to those lowly people, that's too much!"
part-9-1-13,"Monk, I see there are so many of you, you can't finish it all. You should leave some good karma by doing good deeds."
part-9-1-14,Stop!
part-9-1-15,I will not tolerate such evil deeds from you!
part-9-2-1,"Haha, now you're chasing me, you'll reap what you sow!"
part-9-2-2,"The wind is too strong, let's go!"
part-9-2-3,Where do you think you're going?
part-9-2-4,"Master, master, we were wrong, please spare us!"
part-9-2-5,"I don't save evil people, but looking at your daily actions, you also have a bit of kindness. If you truly repent, start running south for three hundred miles from now on, don't stop for a moment!"
part-9-2-6,Three hundred miles? Do we really have to run?
part-9-2-7,This...
part-9-2-8,"Run, run, if you don't run now... hehehe haha."
part-9-2-9,"Lai Toudian, are you really going to let them go?"
part-9-2-10,"Are you a disciple of the Buddhist school? If so, we both do not kill. And their karma, hehe, is in the south, not here."
part-9-2-11,"Forget it, let's run!"
part-9-2-12,Three mountain bandits ran away in a puff of smoke.
part-9-2-13,"Aren't you someone from our sect, why did you run over here?"
part-9-2-14,"We caught up with you, we want you to..."
part-9-option1,Go back to {MyFaction}.
part-9-option2,You violated the precepts and were expelled from the sect.
part-9-3-1,We are here to take you back to {MyFaction}.
part-9-3-2,"Hmm... I've seen a lot of karma in the world, and the harvest is quite rich, it's time to go back to {MyFaction}."
part-9-3-3,"You've been indulging in wine and meat, haven't you..."
part-9-3-4,"Lai Toudian, you violated the precepts, the disciplinary monk will decide your punishment."
part-9-3-5,After returning to {MyFaction} with Lai Toudian
part-9-3-6,"The mad monk is back? Good, good, let's see what punishment the disciplinary monks have for you."
part-9-3-7,Lai Toudian... violated the precepts... no punishment.
part-9-3-8,"Ah? Leader, this person has repeatedly violated the precepts, if not punished, other disciples will follow suit, how to convince the public?"
part-9-3-9,"Hehe, wine and meat pass through the intestines, but Buddha remains in the heart. If people learn from me, they will be like entering the demon way."
part-9-3-10,Lai Toudian has reached a state where he is not moved by external things.
part-9-3-11,"For us ordinary monks, if we break the precepts of alcohol and meat, our cultivation will be shaken and we will gradually forget the meaning of Buddhism. When we see the suffering in the world, we will doubt the Buddha's intention and find it hard to calm our minds."
part-9-3-12,"But Lai Toudian has reached a state where external things do not move his heart, and he... is the reincarnation of the Dragon Slayer Arhat."
part-9-3-13,"Wait, if you praise me, I like to hear it. But if you say I'm the reincarnation of some Arhat, I don't like to hear it."
part-9-3-14,"The Buddhist door is wide open, can't it accommodate a mad monk? Lai Toudian is not bound by the precepts of wine and meat here."
part-9-3-15,"But your private exit from the mountain entrance, and affecting other monks' morning classes, indeed need to be punished, you are grounded and not allowed to go out."
part-9-3-16,"Oh... this, when can I go out then?"
part-9-3-17,When you can go out.
part-9-3-18,"The old monk is playing tricks, and I'm not interested! If I can't go out, I'll find my own fun!"
part-9-4-1,"Lai Toudian, you have repeatedly violated the precepts, I am here to expel you, from now on you are no longer a member of {MyFaction}!"
part-9-4-2,"Hey, I thought you were here to help me take off my monk shoes."
part-9-4-3,"As a monk, I still have a lot of karma to observe in the world, I'm leaving!"
part-9-4-4,Lai Toudian left singing a song and shaking his broken Cattail fan.
part-9-5-1,These Mountain Bandits are quite skilled...
part-9-5-2,"Get lost and don't let me see you again, if you steal my food again next time, I will break your hands and feet!"
part-9-5-3,"Huff, oh, my head hurts."
part-9-5-4,Huh? Huh? You are...
part-9-5-5,"No, no, you've got the wrong person."
part-9-5-6,"I'm not mistaken, you're the monk who saved me!"
part-9-5-7,"You're still a Mountain Bandit today, and you said you swore because I forced you, it doesn't sound good if this gets out, does it?"
part-9-5-8,I... I... was forced by the world...
part-9-5-9,"The world does bear some responsibility, but the main problem is you."
part-9-5-10,I... ask the master for guidance.
part-9-5-11,"You three, run three hundred miles to the south, don't stop for a moment, go quickly!"
part-9-5-12,"Alright, master, we will go now."
part-9-5-13,"What, big brother, do we really have to run?"
part-9-5-14,"Three hundred miles, I'll run out of breath before I can get away."
part-9-5-15,"Fool! The master is saving us, run now!"
part-9-5-16,Three mountain bandits ran away in a puff of smoke.
part-9-5-17,"What's going on with Lai Toudian, he's actually in cahoots with the Mountain Bandits."
part-9-5-18,"Hmm... aren't you guys who and who, why did you run over here?"
part-9-5-19,"We caught up with you, we want you to..."
part-9-6-1,"Master, that mad monk has run far away, we don't know where he went."
part-9-6-2,Okay... I see.
part-10-0-1,What's all the noise outside?
part-10-0-2,"An outsider Monk has come to challenge us, without your permission, none of the Disciples have responded."
part-10-0-3,"Okay, I'll send someone to meet him."
part-10_name,Martial Monk visits
part-10_overview,"There is a foreign Monk who wants to challenge us, please send someone to meet him as soon as possible."
part-10-1-1,Who is coming to challenge {MyFaction} this time?
part-10-1-2,"It's me, my Dharma name is Shi Yu, I'm here to learn about {MyFaction}'s Martial Arts."
part-10-1-3,"Your Dharma name is Shi, which temple are you from?"
part-10-1-4,"My master is a wandering monk, he took me as his Disciple, shaved my head, and taught me martial arts."
part-10-1-5,"It's not that wandering Monk from {MyFaction}, is it?"
part-10-1-6,"Do you know what your master's Dharma name is, is he a Monk from my {MyFaction}?"
part-10-1-7,My master's Dharma name... I forgot.
part-10-1-8,Is that so? Where did your master go?
part-10-1-9,"My master was seriously injured after wiping out a nest of Mountain Bandits, he got up to save the villagers as soon as his injury healed, but he died later."
part-10-1-10,"My master said that my mind is not very bright, and I will definitely forget the sect's words in the future, so he told me to challenge any sect I see, as long as the martial arts are the same, it should be the same sect."
part-10-1-11,It seems that the master knows his disciple better.
part-10-1-12,Then let's have a match!
part-10-2-1,"This move, Arhat Fist, and this Bodhi Palm... Master, I've arrived..."
part-10-2-2,"I want to go into the temple to have a look, my master has mentioned a lot of things about {MyFaction}, the plum blossom piles in the Pond, the stone stele, the Forest Tower, the big bell, and the Monk's Living Quarter where my master used to live!"
part-10-2-3,"Don't worry, let's go to the Hall of Great Strength first, check your master's name, this compassionate master's name cannot be forgotten."
part-10-2-4,"Then introduce you to everyone, and then announce your return to {MyFaction}. How about that?"
part-10-2-5,Very good! Very good! Let's go in quickly!
part-10-3-1,"Master, the Monk who challenged us outside the gate has run away, he said he would come back if he couldn't find it."
part-10-3-2,I hope this will help to dissipate his anger.
part-11-0-1,"Master! The guest monk reported that a Monk with wounds all over his body fell outside the gate, it's best to go and see what happened."
part-11-0-2,"This is serious, I will send someone to check it out."
part-11_name,Blood Hand Yan Luo
part-11_overview,"A Monk with wounds all over his body fell outside the gate, go and see what happened."
part-11-1-1,The injured person is there! Go and check it out quickly!
part-11-1-2,Uh...
part-11-1-3,The injury seems to be serious.
part-11-1-4,Thank you... I... have...
part-11-1-5,"Don't talk first, otherwise it would be bad if you lose your breath."
part-11-1-6,No... there... someone is trying to kill me... be careful...
part-11-1-7,What?
part-11-1-8,It seems to be here!
part-11-1-9,"How come one bald donkey is not enough, there are three more bald donkeys?"
part-11-1-10,Evil doer! My Buddha will not let you do as you please!
part-11-2-1,"Damn it, let's retreat!"
part-11-2-2,"The masked men disappeared quickly, as if everything just now was an illusion."
part-11-3-1,"Hehehe. You guys from {MyFaction} are too weak, aren't you?"
part-11-3-2,"Wait, something is wrong!"
part-11-3-3,The master has issued an order! Retreat quickly!
part-11-3-4,The masked men disappeared quickly.
part-11-4-1,"Don't chase for now, this person is seriously injured, let's take him back quickly!"
part-11-4-2,You carefully carried the seriously injured Monk into the medical hall of the sect.
part-11-4-3,Put him down gently! Let me see his injuries!
part-11-4-4,There is this blood-red palm print on the chest... it's Blood Hand Yan Luo!
part-11-4-5,Are you talking about the famous Blood Hand Yan Luo in the rivers and lakes?
part-11-4-6,"It's okay, this palm didn't hit the vital point. I can cure it, but how to recover afterwards depends on his Constitution."
part-11-4-7,"A few days later, the severely injured Monk was finally able to get out of bed."
part-11-4-8,Can you walk on the ground? How is the open wound healing?
part-11-4-9,"Thank you {MyFaction} for saving my life, please accept my bow!"
part-11-4-10,"Saving lives and healing the wounded is what we {MyFaction} should do, but we want to know, where are you from, Monk, how did you provoke the pursuit?"
part-11-4-11,"I am not a Monk, just a martial artist who knows a little bit of martial arts in the rivers and lakes. Once I accidentally bumped into the secret of the Nine Factions Sect and was discovered by them."
part-11-4-12,"I fled everywhere, even shaved my head and pretended to be a monk, but I couldn't escape. Fortunately, I ran to the door of Shifa Temple in the end, otherwise I would really be finished."
part-11-4-13,"Master, I have an unreasonable request."
part-11-4-14,"Please {MyFaction} take me in! I am willing to become a real monk, I want to become a monk!"
part-11-4-15,Why did you become a monk?
part-11-4-16,"I... I actually want to seek the protection of {MyFaction}, and at the same time, I want to learn {MyFaction}'s martial arts to protect myself."
part-11-4-17,"Your words are sincere, but I'm afraid that Bloodhand Yanluo will always be in your heart."
part-11-4-18,As for whether you can join {MyFaction}...
part-11_option1,"From today, you are the Shi E of {MyFaction}."
part-11_option2,I'm afraid our temple can't protect you.
part-11-5-1,"It seems you don't need to be tonsured anymore. According to seniority, you are of the Shi generation, and your Dharma name is Shi E."
part-11-5-2,"Yes, master."
part-11-5-3,"The Kitchen is short of a cook, you can take up the role."
part-11-5-4,"Master, where can I learn my martial arts?"
part-11-5-5,"You can learn our martial arts in the Training field. When the threat of Blood Hand Yan Luo is eliminated, you can enter the Arhat Hall to learn better martial arts."
part-11-5-6,"Thank you, master!"
part-11-6-1,"I, I..."
part-11-6-2,Please choose a day to leave.
part-11-6-3,Ah... I...
part-11-6-4,"After a few days, the rescued fake monk ran away."
part-11-7-1,The Monk who fell outside the door is nowhere to be found.
part-11-7-2,Amitabha...
part-12-0-1,Hmm... the time is ripe!
part-12-0-2,"Recently, various factions have been fighting each other, it's a good time to sneak into Yunlin Temple and ask for the master's help!"
part-12_name,Unseal
part-12_overview,"The time is ripe, it's time to rescue your master..."
part-12-1-1,"Yunlin Temple, is this place!"
part-12-1-2,Senior Chu Kuangsheng is imprisoned in the Ice Prison below this place.
part-12-1-3,"Once we rescue Senior Chu Kuangsheng, {MyFaction} will be invincible in the world!"
part-12-1-4,"Have you finished talking to yourselves? If you want to rescue the Old Demon, you have to ask me."
part-12-2-1,These bald monks are really troublesome! We will definitely come back!
part-12-2-2,You're welcome to leave.
part-12-3-1,These bald monks are really a nuisance! Let's move the stone tower!
part-12-3-2,"The stone tower was pushed open, revealing the entrance to the Ice Prison that was suppressed by the tower. You quickly entered the Ice Prison."
part-12-3-3,Block the entrance to the Ice Prison!
part-12-3-4,"Fortunately, we were prepared, otherwise we would be trapped here for five days!"
part-12-3-5,"Ahchoo! It's too cold, I can't stand it without running my internal strength to keep warm!"
part-12-3-6,"Why are there three kids here, the timing is wrong, it's not time to send people yet..."
part-12-3-7,"We are from {MyFaction}, we are here to rescue you!"
part-12-3-8,"Oh? Hahaha, come, let me see what {MyFaction} has become after being in the Ice Prison for so long!"
part-12-3-9,Please enlighten me!,โปรดชี้แนะข้าด้วย!
part-12-4-1,"So weak, I was hoping you could help me escape?"
part-12-4-2,……
part-12-4-3,"You guys are totally unqualified, you can only watch these chains with me anxiously."
part-12-4-4,Go back and bring some people with deep skills to help me!
part-12-4-5,"Damn it, we will definitely come back!"
part-12-5-1,Hahahaha! Interesting!
part-12-5-2,"I'm going to try to break free now, you guys come and help me!"
part-12-5-3,So you fought with us to test whether we could help you escape?
part-12-5-4,"That's right, your combined skills are just enough, this time we can definitely break free in one fell swoop!"
part-12-5-5,"There's no time to lose, let's help Chu Kuangsheng with his energy!"
part-12-5-6,Roar! Break it for me!
part-12-5-7,"The Ice Prison shook, with your help, the chains on the ground were actually torn apart by Chu Kuangsheng's bulging veins and muscular arms."
part-12-5-8,Such astonishing strength!
part-12-5-9,I'm finally free! Hahahaha!
part-12-5-10,"Let's go, take me back to {MyFaction}, let me see what the sect looks like now!"
part-12-5-11,"Yes, sir!"
part-12-6-1,
part-13-0-1,"Master, according to the report, some disciples heard two people singing opera in the middle of the night, it may be dangerous, it is recommended to send people to thoroughly investigate this matter."

part-13_name,Farewell My Concubine
part-13_overview,"According to the report, a disciple heard two people singing opera in the middle of the night, which may be dangerous. It is suggested to send someone to investigate this matter."
part-13-1-1,"According to the report, it should be here."
part-13-1-2,"So sleepy, why would anyone sing opera in the middle of the night, and there are two of them, they must be up to no good."
part-13-1-3,"The moonlight is good~, but the sounds of sorrow are everywhere, it's heartbreaking~"
part-13-1-4,"Because the rescue did not arrive~, everyone has the heart to disperse~. Oh, my king, I'm afraid the situation is dire~"
part-13-1-5,Over there!
part-13-1-6,"I see her! This person is dressed in opera costume, dancing with water sleeves, it must be Yu Ji."
part-13-1-7,"Where is the Overlord, the Overlord? Why is there only Yu Ji?"
part-13-1-8,"If the concubine accompanies, wouldn't it hinder the king from killing the enemy? Never mind! I wish to use the king's sword to commit suicide in front of you."
part-13-1-9,She's singing the part where she commits suicide! But why can't I see the Overlord on stage?
part-13-1-10,Could it be that only she is singing tonight?
part-13-1-11,Yu Ji!
part-13-1-12,Is this voice coming from her?
part-13-1-13,What can the Han soldiers do to me? Why did you come here to commit suicide?
part-13-1-14,"Prepare the horses, follow me out!"
part-13-1-15,"Yu Ji's water sleeves, the Overlord's face... It turns out that it has always been one person singing two parts!"
part-13-1-16,What a madman!
part-13-1-17,"You three, are you trying to take my head?"
part-13-1-18,"You can have my head, but you have to take it yourself."
part-13-1-19,"(Mumbling incomprehensible lyrics, he charges at you!)"
part-13-2-1,"Although this person is crazy, he has profound internal strength and may be useful for {MyFaction}."
part-13-2-2,"This is heaven's will to destroy me, not the fault of war!"
part-13-2-3,Why are you still performing... Are you going to commit suicide again?
part-13-2-4,"No, he's really going to commit suicide!"
part-13_option1,Stop him from committing suicide.
part-13_option2,He must still be performing
part-13-3-1,"Although this person is crazy, his profound internal strength can be used for our sect."
part-13-3-2,"Twenty-eight riders lost two, this is heaven's will to destroy me, not the fault of war!"
part-13-3-3,"You've won, why are you still performing... Are you going to commit suicide again?"
part-13-3-4,"No, he's really going to commit suicide!"
part-13-4-1,One of you knocked the sword out of Feng Xizi's hand.
part-13-4-2,"I, the Overlord of Western Chu~, will never be humiliated by the enemy!"
part-13-4-3,"My lord, it's not time for us to stop fighting yet!"
part-13-4-4,What do you mean by this?
part-13-4-5,"Not far away, there are still many Chu soldiers secretly stationed, and the Han soldiers have not yet discovered."
part-13-4-6,"Wait for the king to return and gather the troops, then defeat the Han soldiers!"
part-13-4-7,There are still soldiers I don't know about? Good! Let me regroup and then fight with the Han king!
part-13-5-1,"With a pull of Feng Xizi's hand, his body fell like wheat, and blood gushed out from his throat."
part-13-5-2,Did he... really commit suicide?
part-13-5-3,"Madman, madman!"
part-13-5-4,Bad luck! Let's go!
part-13-5-5,"After you dealt with Feng Xizi, there were no more incidents of singing operas in the middle of the night."
part-13-6-1,"Master, the sound of opera has disappeared recently."
part-13-6-2,It's best for such people to disappear on their own.
part-14-0-1,"Master, recently a Taoist priest has been swindling outside, many disciples have been deceived, and they have come to complain and hope that someone can be sent to deal with it."

part-14-1-3,You can see that my forehead is dark?
part-14-1-4,"That's not what I meant, sir. Besides your dark forehead, there are many signs that you are in constant disaster."
part-14-1-5,Please sit down and let me read your palm...
part-14-1-6,"Since you've stopped me, then I have to..."
part-14_option1,Sit down and see what you can do.
part-14_option2,Get out of here and don't come back.
part-14-2-1,"You have a big temper... Since I'm not welcome here, I'll leave."
part-14-2-2,"I can't take these things with me, so I might as well give them to you as gifts."
part-14-2-3,"Sun Daoren packed up his things unhurriedly and then ran away from here. With this warning, he should not dare to come back."
part-14-3-1,"Come, let me read your palm."
part-14-3-2,"Let's not talk about palmistry... Your pulse suggests that you have a hidden disease, which may be the reason for your dark forehead."
part-14-3-3,Have you switched from fortune-telling to medical treatment?
part-14-3-4,"To make a living, you have to have multiple skills."
part-14-3-5,"I have a hidden disease, why don't I know?"
part-14-3-6,"Hidden disease, if you feel it, it won't be a hidden disease."
part-14-3-7,"I'm not trying to scare you or cheat you out of your money, but you're lucky to meet me today, you can be saved."
part-14-3-8,Can you cure me?
part-14-3-9,"Of course I can cure. And I don't charge for medical treatment, I only charge for medicine."
part-14-3-10,"Look, this cold medicinal pill in my hand, which I refined for 49 days, can definitely cure you. You are lucky, you don't have to delay your illness for 49 days."
part-14-3-11,Oh? Let me see... swallow it!
part-14-3-12,"Um, um! Cough cough cough cough cough..."
part-14-3-13,"What else do you have, cold medicinal pills, fire-reducing pills, kidney-replenishing pills, put them all out, let me see what else you can do!"
part-14-4-1,I won't fight anymore! I admit defeat!
part-14-4-2,"Alas... My eating utensils have been broken, and I have to start all over again."
part-14-4-3,"This guy is good at deceiving people and his martial arts are also good, maybe he can be used for {MyFaction}."
part-14-4-4,"Your persuasion skills are good, {MyFaction} needs talents like you."
part-14-4-5,Huh? You beat me up and smashed my bowl just to recruit me?
part-14-4-6,"Even if I didn't beat you up today, you would have been beaten up sooner or later for your deceitful ways, even chased for thousands of miles."
part-14-4-7,"Now I give you a chance, with {MyFaction} as your backing, you can slowly reform."
part-14-4-8,"It's not a good life to be a drifter without a backing... It's not bad to eat under {MyFaction}. Okay, I'll join."
part-14-5-1,Alas! My eating utensils have been broken... I have to start all over again.
part-14-5-2,"You are from {MyFaction}, right? Pay up! 1200 coins for a set!"
part-14-5-3,Should I compensate?
part-14_option3,"It's just 1200 coins, I'll compensate."
part-14_option4,I suspect you're trying to scam me with these fragile items.
part-14-6-1,"It's so damaged, it's only right for me to compensate both morally and logically."
part-14-6-2,Go! Take me to {MyFaction}! I won't leave until I've made a full set of utensils!
part-14-6-3,"Sun Daoren stayed in {MyFaction}, even after his scamming tools were made, he had no intention of leaving. Over time, everyone considered him as one of {MyFaction}."
part-14-7-1,"So you're a lonely ghost! You were the one who started it... Forget it, I probably can't squeeze anything out of you. I'm leaving this place, goodbye!"
part-14-7-2,Sun Daoren swaggered away. You barely recovered and returned to the sect with injuries.
part-14-8-1,"Master, the swindling Taoist priest has run away."
part-14-8-2,"He ran away after getting enough, huh? I guess he'll come back."
part-15-0-1,"Master, recently there is a rumor in the city that a beautiful woman with excellent musical skills has appeared. Her music can be heard for miles. Can we recruit her into our sect?"

part-15-1-1,"Beautiful lady, beautiful lady, you accepted the red silk I sent you last night, why didn't you join me for a drink?"
part-15-1-2,"Thank you for your love for my music, but I only play music and don't drink with others."
part-15-1-3,"No problem, you can learn to drink slowly. Trust me, you'll love the taste of alcohol."
part-15-1-4,"Thanks for the offer, but I have important things to do right now. If you keep blocking me..."
part-15-1-5,"Hey, you guys, can't you see that the lady is not interested?"
part-15-1-6,Who is this jerk? Don't disturb me and Miss Qincheng's conversation!

part-15-2-4,"Your ears won't be hearing anything for a while - Miss Qincheng, are you alright?"
part-15-2-5,"Thank you both, I'm fine. I heard you mention earlier, are you from {MyFaction}?"

part-15-3-6,"Thank you very much, sir."
part-15-3-7,"The Bailiff, with his fervent enthusiasm, took away the rich young master and his followers."
part-15-3-8,Miss Qincheng seems to have a high reputation here.
part-15-3-9,"It's all thanks to the audience's love. Compared to {MyFaction}'s music, Qincheng's music is just like a candle in the wind."
part-15-3-10,"I set out today to find the seniors of {MyFaction}, I just didn't expect to encounter such people on the way."
part-15-3-11,"Well then, why don't you come back with us? With your performance just now, you might be the best of your class."

part-15-4-2,I was too busy and neglected... it seems it's not meant to be.
part-16-0-1,"I heard a terrible flute sound today, did some mediocrity sneak into our sect?"
part-16-0-2,"Master, the flute sound came from outside the sect."
part-16-0-3,It seems they want to recommend themselves in this way... send someone to check their qualifications.

part-16-1-4,"Hi there, senior."
part-16-1-5,"What a lovely little girl, what's your name, what are you playing?"

part-16-1-26,What's wrong? Is my daddy sick?
part-16-1-27,"No pulse, he's already dead, he probably died around Shen Shi yesterday."
part-16-1-28,"Little girl, I need to have a private talk with your daddy, why don't you go outside and play for a while?"
part-16-1-29,Okay.
part-16-1-30,"Yu Wei'er hopped out of the Dilapidated Temple. The temple was silent, you were thinking about how to deal with the cold body, but the intermittent flute sound came from outside the temple."
part-16-1-31,"I see, senior, you wanted to entrust your daughter to {MyFaction}, didn't you?"
part-16-1-32,A moment later
part-16-1-33,"Sister, are you out? Did daddy bully you? He likes to soak his hands in cold water and then pinch my face."

part-18-1-4,You didn't rob money?
part-18-1-5,"What a joke! When MeE Qigai begs for money, people willingly take it out of their own pockets and put it in my bowl."
part-18-1-6,"If you don't believe me, you can give me money!"
part-18-1-7,"Joke, I don't believe you, and I give you money? I'll just..."
part-18-2-1,Hahaha! Look! Did I rob this? Isn't it you who voluntarily gave me the money?
part-18-2-2,Are all of you from {MyFaction} this adorable? I'm starting to want to visit your place!
part-18-2-3,Why don't you stop wandering aimlessly and join us at {MyFaction}?
part-18-2-4,"Hmm... not wandering, indeed it's a good prospect, but you can't affect me to continue begging!"
part-18-2-5,"If you're willing to work for us, you can continue to be a beggar in your spare time, but you can't act recklessly towards the common people!"
part-18-2-6,"I don't care! If you don't bother me, I won't bother you. Those who have been driven away by me these past few days were all trying to bully this beggar."

part-19-3-5,"Look at you, putting yourself in such a dangerous situation today!"
part-19-3-6,Uncle! Didn't I see through the ambush...
part-19-3-7,"You did see through it, but your martial arts skills are not enough to protect yourself. If I hadn't arranged for more people to protect you in secret, you would have been in trouble!"
part-19-3-8,Stay in your room and don't run around!
part-19-3-9,"Hmph, such petty tricks can't trap me..."
part-19-4-1,"Uncle, didn't you say you would send someone with me to investigate? I've been waiting for you for so long and not a single person has come!"
part-19-4-2,"Oh, I've been too busy, I have hundreds of mouths to feed as soon as I wake up and open my eyes, I forgot. I'll send someone right away!"

part-20-1-4,"If you have something to say, you can talk to me."
part-20-1-5,"Good, I just... want to do business with you."
part-20-1-6,"Doing business? You're holding our brothers hostage, is this your attitude towards doing business?"
part-20-1-7,"Don't worry, whether the deal is successful or not, I guarantee that these people will be able to swim back to shore safely. We have no choice but to do this in order to negotiate business with your faction."
part-20-1-8,"You sure make a big fuss about doing business... if you want to talk, let's talk."
part-20-1-9,"I have a batch of pills on hand, which were obtained from some sects that we can't afford to offend. Now I can't get rid of them, I want to find a buyer to dispose of them cheaply."
part-20-1-10,"Let's be frank, you're taking the risk, I won't ask for too high a price..."
part-20-1-11,"For just 1000 coins, you can buy a large bag of pills, including healing medicine, preservation pills, healing ointment and so on. What do you think?"
part-20-option1,Deal (1000 Coins).
part-20-option2,Not acceptable.
part-20-2-1,"Buying these pills for 1000 coins, considering the risk, is a great bargain for us."
part-20-2-2,"These pills are now floating near the shore, don't worry, the waterproof measures are very good, they won't sink."
part-20-2-3,"I'll give you the money, how can you guarantee the safety of my brothers?"
part-20-3-1,"No problem, if the deal doesn't go through, we still have our principles."
part-20-3-2,"Don't worry, even if the deal doesn't go through, your brothers will be able to escape safely, but only after the ship has reached a safe place."
part-20-3-3,How can I trust you?
part-20-4-1,"I'll act as a hostage to guarantee the safety of these brothers. Once they swim back to the water stronghold, you can release me, how about that?"
part-20-4-2,"You alone, guarantee the safety of my brothers?"
part-20-4-3,"Yes, just me, how about it?"
part-20-4-4,Hmph... you do have guts!
part-20-4-5,"Zhuge Shenji, surrounded by dozens of blades, remains calm and gently fans his feather fan."
part-20-4-6,"Report! As soon as that ship ran out of our chasing range, all the kidnapped brothers swam back."
part-20-4-7,"In that case, I trust your faction won't detain a guest, right?"
part-20-4-8,"This person's strategy and courage are exactly what I, {MyFaction}, lack. Should I recruit him?"
part-20-option3,"Are you interested in joining us, {MyFaction}?"
part-20-option4,"Take care, no need to see me out."
part-20-5-1,Want to recruit me? Interesting.

part-20-5-3,"Water flows downward, people strive upward, hahaha, I'm in!"
part-20-5-4,"That's great, come back with me, I'll make sure you get a good position!"
part-20-6-1,"Zhuge Shenji lightly shook his feather fan, walked away leisurely, and disappeared from your sight."
part-20-7-1,"We received a message saying that the standoff lasted too long, they let that ship escape, and got nothing!"
part-20-7-2,I forgot about this for a moment... never mind.

part-21-1-7,Huff!
part-21-1-8,"Damn, subdue the patient first!"
part-21-2-1,I just dreamed that I became a willow tree...
part-21-2-2,Then we can consider that we have practiced with a willow tree.
part-21-2-3,"Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't hurt you, did I?"
part-21-2-4,"Miss Ling's swordsmanship is ever-changing, it's really impressive. Don't rush to apologize, come on, take your medicine."

part-21-2-7,I... please accept my bow!

part-21-2-9,Six shichen later
part-21-2-10,How do you feel?
part-21-2-11,"My mind has never been so clear, and I feel so relaxed... It seems that my disease is completely cured?"
part-21-2-12,A cheer erupted from the thatched cottage.
part-21-2-13,"I, Ling Mengdie, am willing to be a grass ring for {MyFaction} to repay your great kindness!"

part-23-4-3,"After Lu Jian Nan returned to the sect, he was reprimanded by Tang Tai Jun and advised by his cousin. At least until the Little Snow Leopard is tamed, he dare not leave the manor privately."
part-23-5-1,"No, even if this snow leopard's injuries are healed, it won't be of any use to the manor."
part-23-5-2,"But, if this snow leopard doesn't get timely treatment, it might die!"

part-27-4-1,"Damn it, what's the difference between your behavior and robbery!"
part-27-4-2,You dare to argue while doing such human trafficking?

part-28-2-6,"Sword One, you have repeatedly left your post and went down the mountain on your own, how can you bear the responsibility of being the Eldest Brother with such behavior?"
part-28-2-7,"Now that all factions are crusading, it's a special time, I also want to go out and contribute to our sect."
part-28-2-8,"Well, you've been doing righteous deeds every time you go down the mountain. The thank-you letters and commendation letters sent to the sect from the people below have piled up into a large stack."
part-28-2-9,"From today on, you don't have to guard the Weapon Pavilion anymore, do what you want to do."
part-28-2-10,"Really? Thank you, Sect Leader!"

part-29-1-3,"They brought it upon themselves, if they can't get out, so be it. But if they can't bring out the treasures they found, that's a big problem!"
part-29-1-4,Sigh! The most taboo thing in tomb raiding is greed.
part-29-1-5,"You dug a hole and went down, and soon found the location of the trapped people in the tomb. They were separated from you by a stone door that opened from the inside."
part-29-1-6,Hey! Is there anyone inside?
part-29-1-7,"Ah, it's our fellow disciples! You're here to save us!"
part-29-1-8,What's the situation on your side?

part-29-1-12,Fellow traveler? Who are you talking about?
part-29-1-13,"It's me! Vagabond, known as Black Finger!"
part-29-1-14,"After I went down to the tomb, I saw these rookies messing around, thinking that according to the rules of the road, we wouldn't interfere with each other, each taking what we needed."
part-29-1-15,"Damn it, these rookies triggered the Machinery Men, and I got locked up with them!"
part-29-1-16,"Wait a minute, when the door opens, I'll fight the Machinery Men with you!"

part-29-1-18,Okay! Door~ open~
part-29-2-1,Wow... luckily my teeth weren't knocked out!
part-29-2-2,"Your skills are not bad, which sect are you from?"
part-29-2-3,"Me? My sect was wiped out by the Crime Investigation Bureau a long time ago, it's not worth mentioning!"
part-29-2-4,"Your skills are wasted on solo fights, are you interested in joining us {MyFaction}?"
part-29-2-5,You guys {MyFaction}? It's not unreasonable.
part-29-2-6,"Alright, I'll join, I hope to exchange ideas with everyone and win a few big fights!"
part-29-3-1,"Wow, my teeth were knocked out..."
part-29-3-2,Look at me!
part-29-3-3,"Black Finger spat out a tooth, hitting the key joint of the Machinery Man, causing it to stop instantly."
part-29-3-4,"Wow, this skill, it's not ordinary."
part-29-3-5,"Your skills are not bad, which sect are you from?"
part-29-3-6,"Me? My sect was wiped out by the Crime Investigation Bureau a long time ago, it's not worth mentioning!"
part-29-3-7,"Your skills are wasted on solo fights, are you interested in joining us {MyFaction}?"
part-29-3-8,You guys {MyFaction}? It's not unreasonable.
part-29-3-9,"Alright, I'll join, but don't expect me to teach you rookies any skills, haha."
part-29-4-1,"Sect Leader, the disciples who were trapped in the tomb have returned, but they are severely injured and need several months of rest."
part-29-4-2,"This is their fate, destiny cannot be violated!"
part-30-0-1,"Why has the food improved so much recently? Hey, did someone new come to the kitchen recently?"
part-30-0-2,"Big leader, it's a butcher who calls himself the Imperial Chef. He offended someone he shouldn't have in Daliang City, so he came to be a bandit and cook for us."
part-30-0-3,It turns out to be the Imperial Chef... It seems I need to send someone to comfort him.
part-30_name,After the Imperial Chef
part-30_overview,"A butcher who claims to be a master chef has recently joined the sect's kitchen. His cooking skills are extraordinary, maybe you can send someone to visit him."

part-30-1-2,I'm butchering a cow.
part-30-1-3,You're making such a bloody mess just butchering a cow...
part-30-1-4,"Stay away from my knife, if it gets contaminated, the beef won't taste good."
part-30-1-5,That's terrifying... It feels like he wants to eat me...
part-30-1-6,"Pao Chunqiu swings his kitchen knife, and where it goes, the beef falls apart. You notice that this hides a set of good knife skills."
part-30-1-7,This cook... Is he using martial arts to butcher?
part-30-1-8,"Phew, it's done..."
part-30-1-9,"Brother, your knife skills are not bad, which Martial Arts family are you from?"
part-30-1-10,What Martial Arts? This is my family's Imperial Chef knife technique.
