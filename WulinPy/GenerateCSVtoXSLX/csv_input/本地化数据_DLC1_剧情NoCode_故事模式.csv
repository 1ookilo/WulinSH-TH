sto-main-2_2_9,"Both of you are highly skilled, I beg you to stay for a while and protect our village. I have some savings at home, which you can use to train the villagers, recruit soldiers and buy horses."
sto-main-2_2_10,"Well, this is interesting. You say protector, but it sounds more like the leader of a small sect."
sto-main-2_2_11,"Young hero, if you wish to manage this humble village into a sect, it's not a problem. Apart from my grandson and I who are incapable of fighting, the other villagers would be blessed to receive martial arts teachings from the two of you."
sto-main-2_2_12,"Starting with a sect and then dominating the martial world, this is too cool!"
sto-main-2_2_13,What should I name my sect?
sto-main-2_2_14,"Don't run away if you dare, let's see if our Blue Wind Camp can flatten this broken village <color=#a94e37>three months later</color>. If you know what's good for you, clean yourself up and wait for death!"

sto-KW-2-1_2_8,"Sister, hide behind me, let your big brother protect you!"
sto-KW-2-1_3_1,I didn't expect Ding Fengbo to be so brave in such a desperate situation... Let's spare these poor siblings.
sto-KW-2-1_3_2,"Although we can't report to Duke Kang, we have no choice but to retreat for now."
sto-KW-2-1_4_1,"The Ding siblings have been captured by us, it's fate."

sto-KW-2-2_1_2,"All that work for nothing... But this doesn't count as a failure, I believe Duke Kang will have other tasks for us."
sto-KW-2-2_2_1,"The once formidable Shui Village that dominated the nine rivers\nIs now at your mercy\nAs the sun sets and the waves roll\nDing Fengbo remains silent, admitting his inferior skills\nBut their failure was already destined when they broke their oath to rob the rich to help the poor..."

sto-KW-3_1_1,"Master, Duke Kang sent a message saying that the Langya Sword Pavilion's sword casting ceremony is in 3 months, and he would like to invite you to accompany him."
sto-KW-3_1_2,"Having me travel all the way to join such an event, it can't be as simple as just accompanying him..."
sto-KW-3_1_3,"Not only does he want our sect to be his free bodyguards, but he also wants to show the world that we have been recruited by him, what a clever plan."
sto-KW-3_1_4,"What should we do, should we go to the ceremony as he wishes?"
sto-KW-3_op_1_1,"We can't be controlled by others, whoever wants to go to the ceremony can go"

sto-KW-3_2_3,"Yes, I'll write it right away."
sto-KW-3_2_4,"According to the disciple who delivered the letter\nDuke Kang was not only calm when he saw the letter\nHe also kindly entertained the disciple for three days\nBut you know very well, the real power players never show their true feelings..."

sto-KW-3_4_3,"Fellow seniors, fellow Daoists, this sword is named Piercing the Heavens, made by MeLangya Sword Pavilion from meteorite iron and South Sea shark stone. The blade is three feet and four inches long, weighs seven pounds and four ounces, and can cut hair and break jade."
sto-KW-3_4_4,"As expected of the Sword Pavilion, famous for its sword casting, such a divine weapon is beyond the reach of ordinary sects."
sto-KW-3_4_5,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, I have taken a liking to this divine sword. The wooden heads of the Sword Pavilion will certainly not part with it. Could you speak for me?"
sto-KW-3_4_6,"Since your Highness has taken a liking to it, then {PlayerSurName} I will certainly accompany you."
sto-KW-3_4_7,"Good! You are indeed a master that I admire. After the matter is done, I will definitely reward you!"
sto-KW-3_4_8,"The Old Man, my master, is the one who doesn't want this sword to come out. He went to great lengths to hold this sword casting conference. I, Dugu Jianyi, am here to thank everyone for their support!"
sto-KW-3_4_9,"Since you are thanking us for our support, why don't the two young heroes represent the Sword Pavilion and give this Piercing the Heavens to me, the Sect Leader?"
sto-KW-3_4_10,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, you are joking. This divine sword is the treasure of MeLangya Sword Pavilion, how dare we give it away lightly?"
sto-KW-3_4_11,"You make a good point, but..."
sto-KW-3_4_12,What if {PlayerSurName} I insist on having it?
sto-KW-3_4_13,Insist on having it? Let's see if you can take it first!
sto-KW-3_5_1,"I didn't expect a sect leader to be so incompetent, making a fool of himself in public!"
sto-KW-3_5_2,"Duke Kang, {PlayerSurName} I am inferior in skill and I am here to apologize..."
sto-KW-3_5_3,"Victory or defeat is a common occurrence in the military. You don't need to blame yourself too much. Since that's the case, there's no need to stay here anymore, let's go."
sto-KW-3_6_1,Such strong strength...
sto-KW-3_6_2,"Without the master making a move, we can't take him down..."
sto-KW-3_6_3,"What a pity, the mighty Langya Sword Pavilion, is this all the strength you have? If that's the case, I, {PlayerName}, will gladly accept this Piercing the Heavens!"

sto-KW-3_6_5,"Young friend, have you asked me before you want to snatch the sword from my Sword Pavilion?"

sto-KW-3_6_8,"It's a pity that this divine sword can't belong to me, it's really fate..."
sto-KW-3_6_9,I didn't expect Duke Kang to care about my safety... It seems he doesn't just want to use me.
sto-KW-3_6_10,"But he underestimated me a bit, when I go back and mobilize my sect's Disciples, I might be able to destroy the Sword Pavilion and seize the divine sword, hmph..."
sto-KW-3_7_1,"Sect Leader, Duke Kang sent a message expressing his disappointment in your breach of promise..."

sto-KW-3_9_1,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, I was planning to attend the Sword Casting Convention, but you took it upon yourself to annihilate the Sword Pavilion. Are you deliberately trying to embarrass me?"

sto-KW-3-1_1_4,"The divine sword Piercing the Heavens is in hand, let me think, should I give it to Duke Kang, or keep it for myself?"
sto-KW-3-1_op_1_1,"Give it to Duke Kang, for greater benefits"
sto-KW-3-1_op_1_2,"Keep it for myself, make the best use of everything"
sto-KW-3-1_2_1,"Although this sword is good, sacrificing a pawn to save a chariot, giving it to Duke Kang will surely bring greater benefits."

sto-KW-4_1_4,"In the past, the martial arts world respected the three sects and refused to cooperate with me. Now these arrogant people have their homes broken and are fleeing in disarray, it's really satisfying!"
sto-KW-4_1_5,I brought a lot of supplies this time for you to make further progress and become a truly top sect in the martial arts world.
sto-KW-4_1_6,"Thank you, your Highness!"
sto-KW-4_1_7,"Don't be polite, your success is my success, your loss is my loss, keep up the good work!"

sto-KW-4_2_2,{PlayerSurName} pays his respects to your Highness.
sto-KW-4_2_3,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader is my confidant, don't be polite."
sto-KW-4_2_4,"I heard that you have been ruling well, and in a short period of time, you have developed {MyFaction} to a level that can compete with the three sects."
sto-KW-4_2_5,"I intend to support your sect to become the number one sect in the martial arts world, what do you think?"

sto-KW-4_4_2,"Very well, it seems everyone is here."
sto-KW-4_4_3,The reason why this king invited you sect leaders is to let you make friends through martial arts and exchange ideas.
sto-KW-4_4_4,"Now my Zhao country is plagued by internal and external troubles, and the local princes and old generals are self-reliant. The only hope is for you martial arts enthusiasts to decide on a leader to help this king restore order."
sto-KW-4_5_1,"The royal family has commanded, and this old man should obey. But the former emperor fell into the enemy camp, and many princes claimed to be orthodox, and this Dojokeeper really can't judge."
sto-KW-4_6_1,"Although Duke Kang is of noble status, if he does not have the orthodox status, I am afraid this old Taoist cannot obey."
sto-KW-4_7_1,"Amitabha, your highness makes sense, but in the old monk's view, even if a leader is forcibly decided, it is still an illusion and cannot achieve what your highness wants."
sto-KW-4_8_1,"Sect leaders, please calm down, what is this?"
sto-KW-4_9_1,Imperial token!
sto-KW-4_10_1,I didn't expect the Imperial token to be in your hands...
sto-KW-4_11_1,"Since your highness holds the Imperial token, this old minister should obey!"
sto-KW-4_12_1,"This Imperial token was left by the emperor before he left, and your highness holds this token, it is naturally as if the emperor is here!"
sto-KW-4_12_2,"Since the sect leaders are hindered by their status, let {PlayerSurName} take the lead and set an example!"
sto-KW-4_13_1,The old Taoist will first learn the high tricks of the {PlayerSurName} sect leader!
sto-KW-4_14_1,"{PlayerSurName} donor's martial arts are not bad, please be merciful."

sto-KW-4_17_3,"Thank you for your kindness, your highness!"
sto-KW-4_18_1,You really didn't disappoint this king! I'm afraid there are no more than a handful of people in the world who can compete with you.

sto-KW-6_4_3,"You embroidered pillow is not worthy to die under my knife, get out!"
sto-KW-6_5_1,"Master, that Japanese ronin saw that our sect was always closed and not coming out, so he spread rumors everywhere that our sect was timid and afraid. If this word reaches Duke Kang's ears, I'm afraid it will make the Duke unhappy with us."

sto-KW-11_1_7,"Duke Kang, you're joking. How could they compare with you?"
sto-KW-11_1_8,You've done a great job. Such a heroic act of turning the tide is probably unprecedented since the founding of this dynasty!
sto-KW-11_1_9,"When the mission is completely accomplished, the king will definitely have a good drink with you!"
sto-KW-11_1_10,Then it's a deal with your highness!

But unexpectedly, Duke Kang, in order to ascend to the throne, not only forged the Imperial token, but also deliberately provoked the Yan Yun Iron Army to invade, and raised the enemy to strengthen himself!"

sto-KW-16_2_2,"Why is His Majesty so stingy, not giving me a bigger cup for this great meritorious official!"
sto-KW-16_2_3,"I'm just afraid that you'll get drunk and roll around in this Golden Throne Hall. It's not just about the dignity of the royal family, but also about your image as a top martial artist of the number one sect in the martial arts world, hahaha."

sto-KW-16_3_5,Pity what?
sto-KW-16_3_6,"It's a pity that you, Duke Kang, are too clever for your own good, and it cost you your life..."

sto-CW-1_3_3,"Hmm... You make a good point, {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, could you help me subdue Tiger Escort, so that they cannot stir up trouble for several years?"
sto-CW-1_3_4,Leave such a small matter to our sect.

sto-FCT-3_7_4,"Disciple heard today that the sect leader of Qu is wandering the world. If our sect increases the Herb reserve to <color=#a94e37>2000</color>, we can definitely invite her to join."

sto-FCT-4_1_1,"Leader, that Official Envoy is gathered outside the door with many Officials, insisting on seeing you."
sto-FCT-4_1_2,It seems they've forgotten the pain once the wound has healed. Let me go and see them.
sto-FCT-4_1_3,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader, you allowed Disciple to kill government soldiers, how impressive!"
sto-FCT-4_1_4,"What a joke, you government people always make up stories."
sto-FCT-4_1_5,"The guerrilla general who came before, in order to gain merit, led his troops to attack our sect, trying to kill the innocent for his own benefit. Our sect is only trying to protect itself, what crime have we committed?"
sto-FCT-4_1_6,"Since the Guerrilla General is missing and there is no witness, I have no intention of arguing with you."
sto-FCT-4_1_7,"Oh? So, you came to our sect, is it to have tea and visit?"
sto-FCT-4_1_8,"Of course not, I came here in the name of Shangfeng, to collect the tax for the past three months from {PlayerSurName} sect leader."
sto-FCT-4_1_9,"Interesting, what if I don't want to pay?"
sto-FCT-4_1_10,"Under the sky, all is the king's land. If your sect insists on not paying, then my men will have to take it by force!"
sto-FCT-4_1_11,"It seems that if we don't pay, there will be a conflict. Should we pay the tax..."
sto-FCT-4_op_1_1,Agree
sto-FCT-4_op_1_2,Refuse
sto-FCT-4_2_1,"Sir, I'll give you face, we'll pay this tax."
sto-FCT-4_2_2,"You know what's good for you, men, go and check all the accounts of {MyFaction}!"
sto-FCT-4_3_1,"If you want to collect tax from our sect, let's see if you have the ability!"
sto-FCT-4_3_2,"Openly resisting tax, is tantamount to rebellion! Come on, arrest these rebels for me!"
sto-FCT-4_4_1,"Wait until I report to the court, you will have to apologize and be punished... Let's go!"
sto-FCT-4_4_2,Don't let the door hit you on the way out!
sto-FCT-4_5_1,"The officials I brought are not ordinary, they are all skilled people who have joined the government, how can you wild foxes be their match?"
sto-FCT-4_5_2,"If we are not as skilled, we can only honestly pay the tax..."
sto-FCT-4_6_1,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader, the three-month period is up, pay the tax honestly."
sto-FCT-4_6_2,"It seems they will come once every three months, should we pay the tax..."
sto-FCT-4_7_1,"These thieves are too powerful, I can't do anything, let's retreat and let Shangfeng find someone else..."
sto-FCT-4_7_2,Don't let the door hit you on the way out!
sto-FCT-4_7_3,"That Official said before leaving that he would let the higher-ups find someone else, I wonder who they will invite to deal with our sect, it's really curious."
sto-FCT-5_1_1,"Go and inform your sect leader, Luo Tianxiong from the Crime Investigation Bureau is here to visit!"
sto-FCT-5_1_2,Luo Constable? What a rare guest.
sto-FCT-5_1_3,"I, Luo, have come here because someone reported that your sect is harboring evil and colluding with bandits, causing trouble in the area."
sto-FCT-5_1_4,"As a constable of the court, I have always been impartial. I hope that {PlayerSurName} sect leader will cooperate and allow me to investigate thoroughly, to clear your sect's name."
sto-FCT-5_1_5,"Innocence? Don't make me laugh, Constable Luo. Whether our sect is innocent or not, there is a fair conscience to prove it. Why bother with this investigation?"
sto-FCT-5_1_6,"Hmph... I came with good intentions, but it seems I have only caused a misunderstanding with {PlayerSurName} sect leader."
sto-FCT-5_2_1,"Yo, isn't this the famous Luo Constable? What, not meeting your performance targets, so you're randomly arresting people to make up the numbers?"
sto-FCT-5_2_2,"Hua Qingqing... {PlayerSurName} sect leader, you have taken in such a despicable thief, and you still claim that your sect is not colluding with bandits and harboring evil?"
sto-FCT-5_2_3,"Out of respect for the rules of the martial world, I will give you a way out: as long as you disband {MyFaction} within <color=#a94e37>three months</color>, I will let bygones be bygones."
sto-FCT-5_2_4,"If you insist on resisting to the end, don't blame the Crime Investigation Bureau for being ruthless!"
sto-FCT-5_2_5,"I have said my piece, you should consider your actions carefully. I will take my leave now."
sto-FCT-5_3_1,Bro... Chief Constable!
sto-FCT-5_3_2,"Qianxue? I heard you were still wandering around the martial world, but I didn't expect to find you in {MyFaction}! Perfect, you can come back with me."
sto-FCT-5_3_3,"I can't... Qianxue was in grave danger before, luckily the young hero {PlayerSurName} saved her..."
sto-FCT-5_3_4,"{MyFaction} needs me now, I can't run away!"
sto-FCT-5_3_5,"In that case, I have a question for you, please answer it honestly: has {MyFaction} ever colluded with bandits or acted against the court?"
sto-FCT-5_3_6,"Chief Constable, these are all one-sided words from others..."
sto-FCT-5_3_7,"Those corrupt officials have repeatedly tried to persuade {PlayerSurName} young hero to do their dirty work... After being rejected, they not only provoked intentionally, but also tried to mobilize the official army to kill the innocent and take credit!"
sto-FCT-5_3_8,"All of the above are what Qianxue has seen with her own eyes, there is no falsehood!"
sto-FCT-5_3_9,"My sister has always been honest and upright, she never lies, it seems that I, Luo, have been deceived..."
sto-FCT-5_3_10,I regret believing in slander. This manual is my apology.
sto-FCT-5_3_11,I will find out who is slandering your sect behind your back. I will take my leave now.
sto-FCT-5_3_12,Constable Luo is indeed wise and just. Safe travels!
sto-FCT-5-1_1_1,"The Chief Constable gave you three months to disband your sect, but you stubbornly resist. Go to jail and regret it!"

sto-FCT-5-1_2_3,"{PlayerName}, what kind of scheme are you planning..."
sto-FCT-5-1_2_4,"Constable Qiu, think about it. If I really wanted to harm the people and oppose the government, would I be so restrained?"
sto-FCT-5-1_2_5,"Go back, I hope you can explain to Constable Luo properly. The mighty Crime Investigation Bureau should not become a sharp knife used by villains."
sto-FCT-5-1_2_6,...We will meet again...
sto-FCT-5-1_3_1,"Qiu Zhimo, with the Crime Investigation Bureau, stormed into your sect,\nand you were unprepared, your disciples had no power to resist\nA few rounds later\nyour sect was completely dissolved..."
sto-FCT-6_1_1,"Sect leader, someone has broken into our sect, claiming to collect the taxes we owe!"
sto-FCT-6_1_2,"Strange, those officials were beaten so badly, where did they get the courage to come to our sect again?"
sto-FCT-6_1_3,"It's not the officials, it's a group of eunuchs..."
sto-FCT-6_1_4,What? Eunuchs!
sto-FCT-6_1_5,Our family is here on behalf of Lord Tong of the Imperial City to collect the taxes owed by you {MyFaction}.
sto-FCT-6_1_6,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, since Soldier and Constable are no match for you, naturally it's up to us from the Imperial City to handle this matter. Hand over the taxes quickly, don't be a needless hero~"
sto-FCT-6_1_7,"It seems that if we don't pay, there will be a conflict. Should we pay the tax..."
sto-FCT-6_op_1_1,Agree
sto-FCT-6_op_1_2,Refuse
sto-FCT-6_2_1,"Since it's the Imperial City asking, we'll pay the taxes."
sto-FCT-6_2_2,"{PlayerSurName} Leader is really giving face, my fellows, go collect the taxes for our family!"
sto-FCT-6_3_1,Guess what happened to the last group who forcibly came to our sect to collect taxes?
sto-FCT-6_3_2,How dare you threaten the Imperial City!
sto-FCT-6_4_1,"Today our family is not in a good state, we will visit again another day!"
sto-FCT-6_4_2,These Eunuchs are so annoying with their incessant chatter.
sto-FCT-6_5_1,"The kung fu of our family was personally taught by Lord Tong, it's not something your half-baked skills can compare to."
sto-FCT-6_5_2,"If we are not as skilled, we can only honestly pay the tax..."
sto-FCT-6_6_1,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, the three-month period is up, pay the taxes honestly to our family."
sto-FCT-6_6_2,"It seems they will come once every three months, should we pay the tax..."

sto-FCT-6_7_2,"I heard that this Tong Daofu has been in charge of the Imperial City for many years and has some skills. I, the leader, am looking forward to seeing it!"
sto-FCT-7_1_1,"Leader, there's a beardless Old Man in brocade clothes outside the door, saying that you insulted him and he's here for revenge."
sto-FCT-7_1_2,"Sounds like that old guy Tong Daofu, but when did I insult him, it's really baffling..."

sto-FCT-7_2_2,"I say, Lord Tong, since you hold a high position, you should be smart. But {PlayerSurName} I have some doubts..."
sto-FCT-7_2_3,"Articulate, tell me what's suspicious?"
sto-FCT-7_2_4,"What {PlayerSurName} I doubt is, if a pig says it wants to slap Lord Tong twice, would Lord Tong believe it?"
sto-FCT-7_2_5,"Bold and reckless... dare to mock our family, wait to be implicated with your ten clans!"
sto-FCT-7_2_6,"Guards, protect the leader!"
sto-FCT-7_3_1,"Winning by numbers, hmph, I'll come back to teach you a lesson another day!"
sto-FCT-7_3_2,Is this the strength of the Imperial City's commander? Much weaker than I imagined...
sto-FCT-7_3_3,He deliberately held back.
sto-FCT-7_3_4,"How is that possible, I saw him so angry just now, how could it be fake?"
sto-FCT-7_3_5,"Using fake anger to cover up real probing, this old guy is quite cunning."
sto-FCT-7_3_6,"Eh, why is there suddenly a Manual on the ground, could he be trying to do us a favor?"
sto-FCT-7_4_1,"Leader, we've been ignoring that old Eunuch, now he sneaks into our sect and kills anyone he sees, only one in ten Disciples are left..."
sto-FCT-7_4_2,"Our family thought you were some kind of divine being with three heads and six arms, turns out you're just a mortal. In that case, go die for our family!"
sto-FCT-8_1_1,"Leader, the Steward of Duke Kang's manor has sent someone to our sect, saying they are collecting various supplies for Prepared Yan Nation."
sto-FCT-8_1_2,"Why is Duke Kang, who keeps to his own affairs, also threatening our sect?"
sto-FCT-8_1_3,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, you are mistaken. Duke Kang is the only true emperor of Zhao Nation, how could he threaten us?"
sto-FCT-8_1_4,"His Highness only heard that your sect has been associating with bandits and has a poor reputation, so he specifically provided this opportunity to atone for your sins, showing the benevolence of a wise monarch."
sto-FCT-8_1_5,"This kind of rhetoric is quite far-fetched, should I refuse it or not..."

sto-FCT-8_3_1,"Duke Kang is playing a good game, does he really think he can fool the head of this sect like a three-year-old child?"
sto-FCT-8_3_2,"To give or not to give, do you think you still have the final say?"
sto-FCT-8_4_1,"Duke Kang has ordered, you will have to hand over these supplies sooner or later, just wait and see!"
sto-FCT-8_4_2,"If you don't leave, stay with the head of this sect."
sto-FCT-8_5_1,"Wouldn't it be better to do this earlier, why make both sides unhappy."
sto-FCT-8_5_2,"I'm not as skilled as others, I will avenge this humiliation in the future..."

sto-FCT-8_6_2,"Here we go again, should I give out the supplies or not..."
sto-FCT-8_7_1,"{MyFaction} is far more powerful than Duke Kang imagined, definitely not a soft persimmon that can be kneaded at will, just give up..."
sto-FCT-8_7_2,"The next time we meet, it will be your death date, don't blame me for not warning you!"
sto-FCT-9_1_1,"Head, it's not good, the prestigious Marshal Ye suddenly brought the Ye Family Battalion and surrounded our sect."
sto-FCT-9_1_2,"Marshal Ye has always been loyal and brave to the country, why would he be an enemy of our sect, it must be the confusion of the treacherous!"

sto-FCT-9_2_2,"I received a secret order from Duke Kang, saying that you {PlayerName} are recruiting soldiers and horses intending to cause chaos in the Central Plains, and specially ordered me to suppress {MyFaction} with the Ye Family Battalion."
sto-FCT-9_2_3,"{PlayerSurName} head, do you have any last words?"
sto-FCT-9_2_4,"Marshal Ye is loyal and patriotic, and is one of the few people I admire. Duke Kang's words are all malicious framing, I hope you can distinguish right from wrong!"
sto-FCT-9_2_5,"Humph, eloquent, let's see if you can win my Li Quan Shen Gun first!"
sto-FCT-9_3_1,"I didn't expect you... to be so powerful... I, as a marshal, will die a worthy death!"
sto-FCT-9_3_2,Stop!
sto-FCT-9_3_3,"If you commit suicide, then who will resist the Yan Yun Iron Army!"
sto-FCT-9_3_4,……
sto-FCT-9_3_5,"Marshal Ye, please think twice. If the head of this sect really intends to cause chaos in the Central Plains as Duke Kang said, then I won't save you today!"
sto-FCT-9_3_6,"I understand... After I return to the camp, I will definitely clear the name for {PlayerSurName} head."
sto-FCT-9_3_7,"Yun'er, sound the gong to retreat!"
sto-FCT-9_4_1,"Head, you have been closing the door for three months, and the Ye Family Battalion has taken this opportunity to occupy the strategic locations inside and outside our sect. We are already trapped!"
sto-FCT-9_4_2,I didn't expect to end up losing to Marshal Ye...
sto-FCT-10_1_1,"Our sect has expanded rapidly recently, and it has vaguely become on par with the three religions."
sto-FCT-10_1_2,"That being said, but to confront those cunning and insidious court forces, we are still not strong enough... I hope those few letters can have the expected effect."
sto-FCT-10_1_3,"Head, I have delivered your personal letters to the heads of the three religions. Although they are noncommittal about the proposal to ally with our sect, they are all willing to meet you on the Peak of Challenge."
sto-FCT-10_1_4,"The expected effect has been achieved, the next step is to rush to the Peak of Challenge."
sto-FCT-10_name,Appointment at the Peak of Challenge
sto-FCT-10_log,You have arranged to meet with the heads of the three sects at the Peak of Challenge to discuss the matter of alliance.
sto-FCT-10_2_1,"You traveled light and alone, and arrived at the Peak of Challenge in no time.\nThe heads of the three sects, who once represented the pinnacle of martial arts,\nwere not surprised at your arrival,\njust curiously looking at\nthis rising star in the martial arts world in front of them."
sto-FCT-10_3_1,The reason why I invited the heads here is for a major matter.
sto-FCT-10_3_2,"Now, our Zhao country is in turmoil, the people are suffering, and the internal and external troubles are like a thousand wounds. Do the heads know who is the culprit behind all this?"
sto-FCT-10_4_1,"Although I, the Dojokeeper, was once the regent for the former emperor, I also know that the current situation is the result of the chaos in the court."
sto-FCT-10_5_1,"Although the old Taoist rarely leaves the sect, according to what the disciples who travel around say, the harm to the world, nine out of ten, comes from the disputes between the princes and the power struggles of the courtiers."
sto-FCT-10_6_1,"Amitabha, the culprit in the mouth of {PlayerSurName} donor, is naturally not one person. In the old monk's view, the sin lies in the entire court."
sto-FCT-10_7_1,"Exactly! Since we share the same thoughts with {PlayerSurName}, why not form an alliance with our sect to jointly resist the unrighteous court, safeguard the common people, how about it?"
sto-FCT-10_8_1,"It's sad to see that the three sects, once known as the leaders of the martial arts world, are now left with only one, it's really heartbreaking..."
sto-FCT-10_8_2,"Now, our Zhao country is under the watchful eyes of foreign tribes, and there are traitors plotting within. However, in this critical moment of survival, the court does not think about saving the situation, but instead acts in a contrary way."
sto-FCT-10_8_3,"{PlayerSurName} started from scratch and slowly developed {MyFaction}, but was repeatedly accused by the court of unfounded crimes, exploited and slandered."
sto-FCT-10_8_4,"After thinking about it, {PlayerSurName} believes that although we are people of the martial arts world, we cannot avoid or forgive the atrocities of the court. When the Yan army invades and the country and family are destroyed, how can there be intact eggs under the overturned nest?"
sto-FCT-10_8_5,"Our sect intends to form an alliance with your sect to jointly resist the unrighteous court, safeguard the common people, what do you think?"
sto-FCT-10_9_1,"Alas, when the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold, this is true in ancient and modern times... As long as you win against the old Taoist, this matter can be considered."
sto-FCT-10_10_1,"The old monk agrees very much with what {PlayerSurName} donor has in mind, but this matter is of great importance... Let's do this, you and I will have a contest, and the winner will be determined by martial arts."
sto-FCT-10_11_1,"I've heard that {PlayerSurName} headmaster's martial arts are unparalleled, as long as you win against me, the Dojokeeper will agree!"
sto-FCT-10_12_1,"The heads of the three sects are willing to teach, {PlayerSurName} naturally can't ask for it!"
sto-FCT-10_13_1,The old Taoist is here to learn the high moves of {PlayerSurName} headmaster!
sto-FCT-10_14_1,"{PlayerSurName} donor's martial arts are not bad, please be merciful."
sto-FCT-10_15_1,"This Dojokeeper is a bit itchy, ask {PlayerSurName} for advice!"
sto-FCT-10_16_1,"The Martial Arts of your sect are really profound, {PlayerSurName} narrowly won by one move, thank you for letting me!"
sto-FCT-10_16_2,"You defeated the three sect leaders, who symbolize the martial arts world, on the Peak of Challenge\nThis heroic act that shocked the world\nNot only helped you gain powerful and loyal allies\nBut also became a classic topic of conversation among martial artists..."
sto-FCT-10_17_1,"{PlayerSurName} is not as skilled as others, let's pretend that I never mentioned the matter of alliance."
sto-FCT-11_1_1,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, I have come to congratulate you!"
sto-FCT-11_1_2,"How dare you! Our sect and the government are at odds, and yet you dare to come here seeking death?"
sto-FCT-11_1_3,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, please calm your anger... Qin Huizhi, the imperial censor, has always been concerned about the affairs of the martial arts world. Upon hearing about the misunderstanding between your sect and the court, he was deeply moved and decided to propose a reconciliation in the name of amnesty."
sto-FCT-11_1_4,I am here on the orders of Qin Yushi to invite the head of {PlayerSurName} and the leaders of the three sects to Lin An to discuss this matter.

sto-FCT-11_2_2,"As I said, the martial arts world should value peace. What do you all think?"
sto-FCT-11_3_1,"When I set off for the meeting, my father told me that if Qin Yushi treats people sincerely, we can discuss further. Since Qin Yushi only talks empty words today, I, from the Confucius Temple, will be the first to refuse."
sto-FCT-11_4_1,"Qin Huizhi, your words are flowery, but our temple has always had a rule not to get close to the court or the powerful. I'm afraid I have to refuse."
sto-FCT-11_5_1,"You, Qin Huizhi, are just an imperial censor, not qualified to recruit our sect. Dismiss the meeting quickly, I have to go for a drink!"
sto-FCT-11_6_1,"In that case, I won't force anyone..."
sto-FCT-11_6_2,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, what is your opinion?"
sto-FCT-11_6_3,"Naturally, I don't want to accept the amnesty, but from a utilitarian perspective, agreeing to the amnesty might reduce the conflict between our sect and the court. Should I agree?"
sto-FCT-11_op_1_1,"For the benefit of the sect, agree to the amnesty"
sto-FCT-11_op_1_2,"Amnesty, what a joke!"
sto-FCT-11_7_1,"Qin Huizhi, the conflict between our sect and the court is just a misunderstanding. As long as you are willing to mediate, I will agree to the amnesty."
sto-FCT-11_7_2,"Good! {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader is wise and understanding, I will take care of these matters."
sto-FCT-11_8_1,"Amnesty, what a joke!"
sto-FCT-11_8_2,I have already hated you corrupt officials to the bone. The great land of Zhao will eventually fall into your hands.
sto-FCT-11_8_3,"As the saying goes, when the government is unjust, the world will rise against it. Although I am a person of the martial arts world, I also have the heart to eliminate evil for the country and the people."
sto-FCT-11_8_4,"I will let you, the treacherous official, go today, but don't blame {PlayerSurName} for being ruthless next time we meet!"

sto-FCT-12_1_1,Who is making a racket outside our sect?
sto-FCT-12_1_2,"Reporting to the Sect Leader, it's the envoys sent by Duke Kang and King Chai. They both came to recruit our sect, but they started arguing because of their different positions."
sto-FCT-12_1_3,"Duke Kang and King Chai... Hmph, they are all the same."
sto-FCT-12_1_4,"Go and tell them that our sect only cares about the martial arts world, and will not become anyone's pawn. Tell them to get lost!"

sto-FCT-14_5_1,"Leader, that Japanese ronin has been spreading rumors about our sect being cowardly since we've been keeping to ourselves. Many martial arts practitioners have believed these rumors and are discussing our sect."
sto-FCT-14_5_2,"Things have come to this, there is no room for recovery, let's leave it at that."
sto-FCT-15_1_1,"Leader, the ambition of this Great Ant City is growing. They are not only trying to interfere with the internal affairs of our Zhao Kingdom, but also massacring fellow martial artists, intending to destroy the Central Plains martial arts."
sto-FCT-15_1_2,Such ambitious wolves must be eliminated by our sect as a priority!
sto-FCT-15_name,Eliminate the forces of Great Ant City
sto-FCT-16_1_1,"Master, that Great Ant City has too many grievances, and before our sect could take action, it was already wiped out by other sects."
sto-FCT-16_1_2,"It's important to know oneself, otherwise it will end up like Great Ant City. Don't worry about it, just continue to develop our sect."
sto-FCT-16_2_1,"The glory and ambition of the Liusheng family were destroyed along with the Great Ant City\nFrom Yagyū Musashi down\nAlmost all the rebels were caught in one fell swoop and locked up in the main city's death row\nOnly the princess of the Great Ant City is missing, suspected to be wandering the rivers and lakes..."
sto-FCT-16_2_2,"Sixty years in a dream, a cycle of decay and prosperity in a cup of wine..."
sto-FCT-16_2_3,"It's important to know oneself, or else you'll end up like Great Ant City!"
sto-FCT-16_2_4,"The once arrogant Great Ant City fell at the hands of {MyFaction}, bringing our sect's ideal of Dominating the Martial World one step closer!"
sto-FCT-16_name,"Continue to develop the sect, expand the territory"
sto-FCT-17_1_1,"The Central Plains have always been divided, and now they are even more consumed by internal strife, leaving only a tenth of their national strength. Truly, heaven blesses the Great Yan Kingdom!"
sto-FCT-17_1_2,"Yan Yun Iron Army, heed my command, we march south today!"
sto-FCT-17_1_3,"Sect Leader, the Yan Yun Iron Army that has been entrenched in Yan Yun has taken advantage of Zhao's internal strife, revealing their fangs, mobilizing their army and quickly capturing Daliang City. Chu Xiang and Lin An are now unprotected, they're in grave danger."
sto-FCT-17_1_4,"The Yan Yun Iron Army has been operating in the Yan Yun camp for many years, and now they are heading south with full force, they must be fully prepared."
sto-FCT-17_1_5,We can't just watch the Yan army march south and countless compatriots become homeless!
sto-FCT-17_1_6,"Our sect needs to find a way to firmly control the three places of Da Liang, Lin An, and Chu Xiang, and defend them for at least <color=#a94e37>three months</color> to prevent unexpected events."

sto-FCT-18_1_1,"Leader, the commander of the Yan Yun Iron Army, Wanyan Wuzhu, has sent a secret letter..."
sto-FCT-18_1_2,"Very well, it seems that our defense of the three main cities has seriously hindered the Yan army's invasion plan. Let me see what this guy has to say!"
sto-FCT-18_1_3,"You open the secret letter and read it carefully\nThe letter is half threat, half temptation\nBut there is a hint of negotiation hidden between the lines\nAfter reading the whole letter, you can't help but laugh out loud\nWanyan Wuzhu's intentions are clear..."
sto-FCT-18_1_4,Where is the messenger?
sto-FCT-18_1_5,The Yan soldier disguised as a Zhao person has been captured by our disciples.
sto-FCT-18_1_6,"Let him go, and tell him to pass on a message. If Wanyan Wuzhu is willing to come to our sect and apologize in person, I, being generous, will let him off the hook."
sto-FCT-18_1_7,"Yes, I'll go and do it right away."
sto-FCT-18_1_8,"Just as you expected\nWanyan Wuzhu is furious upon receiving your message\nHe orders all Yan troops to prioritize attacking {MyFaction}\nThe trap is half set\nThe world's safety seems to be in your hands..."

sto-FCT-18_2_1,"Damn it, the three main cities have fallen one after another, both our sect and Zhao have lost their last resistance skill..."
sto-FCT-18_2_2,"The ancient saying ""unable to turn the tide"" probably refers to this situation..."
sto-FCT-19_1_1,"This was Wanyan Wuzhu's best chance to destroy Zhao\nBut you, a rising star, thwarted it\nThe grand camp that stood in Yan Yun for decades\nHas returned to Zhao's embrace today..."

sto-FCT-19_1_3,So tired... Have all the leaders of the major sects left?
sto-FCT-19_1_4,"Reporting to the leader, they have all left."
sto-FCT-19_1_5,"These leaders take turns flattering, it's so annoying. ""Hero of the nation"", ""model of the martial arts world"", they're just afraid of our sect attacking them, that's why they keep talking non-stop..."
sto-FCT-19_1_6,"During this time, I, the leader, must take a good break!"
sto-FCT-20_1_1,"The king is a descendant of the former imperial family, and was granted the title of King Chai by the former emperor, and made a vow to support the Zhao country!"
sto-FCT-20_1_2,"I, the king, wanted to live peacefully and end my remaining life. But unexpectedly, that {PlayerName} colluded with foreign enemies for his own selfish desires. I have learned that the invasion of Great Ant City and the Yan army were all instigated by him."
sto-FCT-20_1_3,"In order to overthrow the Zhao Kingdom, he first instigated the Great Ant City and the Yan army to invade, weakening the court's power. Then, when both sides were both defeated, he took advantage of the situation, intending to deceive the world and steal the title of emperor!"
sto-FCT-20_1_4,"I, the king, hereby issue this coin to announce to the world, there are many loyal and brave men in the various martial arts sects, I hope you will stay true to your hearts, and completely eliminate that {MyFaction}, to prevent the great landscape of our Zhao Kingdom from falling into the hands of such villains!"
sto-FCT-20_1_5,"Leader, Duke Chai's Tower is suddenly spreading coins everywhere, slandering our sect for colluding with foreign enemies and deceiving the world..."

sto-FCT-21_1_2,"{PlayerName}, you are the only person I admire in my life, and also the only person I fear..."
sto-FCT-21_1_3,"Think about it, if {MyFaction} cooperates with me, why worry about not succeeding? When I ascend to the throne smoothly, you will be the number one meritorious official!"
sto-FCT-21_1_4,"No need, I, the leader, don't want to plot with the tiger and ask for trouble."
sto-FCT-21_1_5,"Enough said, Duke Chai, it's time to send you on your way!"
sto-FCT-21_1_6,"Damn... Let you be arrogant for a while, the king will make you have no place to bury in the future!"
sto-FCT-21_1_7,"You didn't expect that there was a secret under King Chai's throne\nWith the combination of thick smoke, tunnels, and machinery\nKing Chai and his followers disappeared in an instant..."

sto-FCT-22_2_2,"Qingqing, why are you so nervous? Tell me, what's wrong?"
sto-FCT-22_2_3,"That King Chai is still at large, always a huge hidden danger. I was worried that he might harm you one day, so I secretly sent people to investigate."
sto-FCT-22_2_4,"My people just sent back a piece of intelligence, saying that although King Chai was defeated by our sect, he is still dissatisfied and is recruiting soldiers and buying horses to bribe the Desperate. He is going to assassinate you in about <color=#a94e37>three months</color>!"
sto-FCT-22_2_5,"Hey, I knew it. It's just a desperate loser. Let him come, the head of the sect is always welcome to visit!"

sto-FCT-23_3_4,"What, the mighty Duke Kang, wants to play the mantis catching the cicada, with the oriole behind?"
sto-FCT-23_3_5,"{PlayerName}, don't blame me for being despicable, your people have just fought a battle, I'm afraid they have no strength left, right?"
sto-FCT-23_3_6,"They have no strength left, but I alone am enough to deal with you!"
sto-FCT-23_3_7,Arrogant! Dying at my hands will be the best end for you!
sto-FCT-23_4_1,"Want to be a chance taker, but don't weigh your own abilities."
sto-FCT-23_4_2,"With my current strength, I'm afraid there's no match for me in the world. Even if there are thousands of armies and horses, they are no match for me."
sto-FCT-23_4_3,"They say that the strong are lonely, and the invincible are solitary. So this is what it feels like, haha!"
sto-FCT-23_5_1,"Leader, King Chai launched a very cruel attack when we were unprepared. The disciples in the sect were caught off guard and were assassinated..."

Story-part1_2_5,……
Story-part1_2_6,"{PlayerSurName} head, you are joking. I came here because I think your sect has strong soldiers and horses, extraordinary strength, and the potential to dominate the martial world, so I came to offer a wise suggestion."
Story-part1_2_7,What suggestion? Let's hear it.
Story-part1_2_8,This wise suggestion is to let Gu join your sect and form a strong alliance to seize the martial world!
Story-part1_2_9,"Brother Gu... I always thought you were a decisive and ruthless hero, but today I find you are so... um... so humorous..."

Story-part1_2_13,(Should I agree to his joining?)
Story-part1_op_1_1,"With Brother Gu joining our sect, it's like adding wings to a tiger."

Story-part1_5_4,"The fox's tail can't be hidden. Even if such a narrow-minded person has high martial arts, there is no need for me to make friends with him."

Story-part2_3_2,"The news of the task completion was sent back to the sect, and you quickly called Gu Qing Yang."
Story-part2_3_3,"Brother Gu, those Western Region wanderers who have been killing you everywhere have been completely wiped out by my sect. From today, you have no worries behind you, and you can fight for my sect with peace of mind."
Story-part2_3_4,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader's kindness, Gu will never forget it with my sword! This sword technique was created by Gu, and I dedicate it to my sect!"

Story-part3_2_1,"This should be the tomb of the previous dynasty, right?"
Story-part3_2_2,"Strange, clearly in the feng shui treasure land of water storage and wind, how could it be washed out by the heavy rain so easily?"
Story-part3_2_3,"If such a situation occurs, it means that the feng shui is not good, but the feng shui here is indeed the best choice... Forget it, if you can't figure it out, go in and explore it first."
Story-part3_2_4,"You lit the fire fold\nAnd started to slowly explore the dark and winding tomb\nWhat's unbelievable is\nThere were wet footprints on the passage that should have been dry..."
Story-part3_2_5,Be alert! Someone has been here in this ancient tomb not long ago!
Story-part3_2_6,"Click, click, click, click...click!"
Story-part3_2_7,Why did the puppets on both sides of the corridor suddenly move? Watch out behind!
Story-part3_3_1,"The disciples suffered heavy losses in the puppet attack, and it's too late to retreat!"
Story-part3_4_1,"That was close, these puppets actually have the strength of a first-class expert in the rivers and lakes..."
Story-part3_4_2,"It seems that the person who sneaked into the tomb before us not only has a high level of skill, but also knows the trigger mechanism of the puppet well. We have to speed up and must not let the treasures in the tomb fall into his hands!"
Story-part3_4_3,"The main tomb should be ahead, there are two giant automatons guarding the door, quickly break them!"
Story-part3_5_1,"The disciples suffered heavy losses in the puppet attack, and it's too late to retreat!"
Story-part3_6_1,Is the main tomb open?
Story-part3_6_2,It's open... but the treasures inside have been swept away...
Story-part3_6_3,How is it possible? How did that person bypass the two giant puppets and take the things inside out?
Story-part3_6_4,"Although you guys are capable, you are all brute force without using your brains, naturally you don't understand the clever method of tomb robbing."
Story-part3_6_5,"The tomb owner here used geomancy to hide the location of the tomb, and used Machinery Puppet to guard the interior, claiming to have mastered the art of wind and water, shallow and deep, and was foolproof."
Story-part3_6_6,"It's ridiculous that he didn't expect that MeMing Bufan had been waiting for this heavy rain for five years. He used the power of heaven and earth to break your geomancy layout. Those puppets are dead objects after all, how can they recognize the high Qinggong of MeTomb Raider Sect!"
Story-part3_6_7,"The treasure in the main tomb has been taken by Me. Since you are also in the same line, Me will share a little with you, goodbye!"
Story-part3_6_8,"The Tomb Raider Sect has been destroyed, but surprisingly, this Ming Bufan doesn't care and continues to rob graves... Anyway, let's take the treasure he left on the ground first."
Story-part3_7_1,"Master, the heavy rain has been pouring for days and nights, and the ancient tomb has been completely destroyed. I'm afraid there is nothing left inside now..."
Story-part3_7_2,What a pity... Maybe we should have sent someone to check it out earlier.
Story-part4_1_1,"Master, the Disciple stationed at the Abandoned Courtyard found that Ming Bufan appeared again, seemingly interested in a half-collapsed pagoda."
Story-part4_1_2,"Although the food and fruits in the surrounding villagers' homes have disappeared repeatedly, there are strange rumors of Bodhisattva descending to the world to fast and guard the pagoda."
Story-part4_1_3,"But as far as Me knows, that pagoda is no different from ordinary ruins. The useful things have been swept away, and all that is left is a pile of junk."
Story-part4_1_4,"Wherever this person appears, there are treasures. He never leaves empty-handed. Me has to send someone to check it out."

Story-part4_2_3,"Sigh, I really don't know what Ming Bufan is doing in this place..."
Story-part4_2_4,"Is it possible that we have fallen into habitual thinking and overlooked something, and this is exactly what Ming Bufan is focusing on?"
Story-part4_2_5,"That makes sense, let Me think..."
Story-part4_2_6,"The ground is all ruins, there can't be any strange places. The ground, the ground... I got it, Ming Bufan's target is underground!"
Story-part4_2_7,"You found some iron shovels\nAnd started to knock and tap following various patterns\nSure enough, you found an underground entrance under the base of a Buddha statue..."
Story-part4_2_8,"Phew, there is actually such a large underground palace hidden under the pagoda."
Story-part4_2_9,"I heard that Monks occasionally build secret underground palaces to store Dharma instruments and relics. Ming Bufan is probably here for these treasures. Wait, there is a sound behind that door!"
Story-part4_2_10,Roar!!!
Story-part4_2_11,"I didn't expect that MeMing Bufan's plan was not as good as heaven's. The ""Bodhisattva"" who descended to fast is not only real, but also a White Ape guarding the underground palace in secret..."
Story-part4_2_12,I was caught off guard and was seriously injured by this beast's sneak attack. It's like heaven wants to kill me.
Story-part4_2_13,"Don't panic, Master, we will help you deal with this White Ape!"
Story-part4_3_1,"I have studied the numbers of all things, but I didn't expect to miscalculate my own death..."
Story-part4_3_2,"Forget it, you guys go quickly, whoever can live is a few. I am seriously injured and just want to end it with this beast."
Story-part4_3_3,"MeMing Bufan always prides himself as the reincarnation of the Star of Fortune, and you, this ape, are regarded as the Bodhisattva descending by the ignorant. Since both are fake constellations and fake Bodhisattvas, let's verify each other's quality!"
Story-part4_3_4,Roar!!!
Story-part4_3_5,"You go to your Western Paradise, I'll return to my Celestial Constellations... Take this! Exploding thunder bullet!"
Story-part4_3_6,"Such immense power! If I had been a step slower, I would have been buried in it..."
Story-part4_3_7,"The underground palace has been completely collapsed, that Ming Bufan and White Ape must have not survived, we can only retreat..."
Story-part4_4_1,"We have subdued this White Ape, considering its loyalty in guarding, let's spare its life."
Story-part4_4_2,"I have lived two lives, thanks to your blessings, I managed to escape death."
Story-part4_4_3,"I say, Sect Leader, you've crossed great rivers and seas, how did you capsize in this small ditch?"
Story-part4_4_4,"There is no more Tomb Raider Sect in the world, don't call me Sect Leader anymore..."
Story-part4_4_5,"I want to repay kindness with kindness. Since your sect has saved my life, let me join your sect as a token of gratitude."
Story-part4_4_6,"Speaking of... you will surely help me heal my wounds, right? I can exchange it with the Tomb Raider Sect's Manual!"
Story-part4_5_1,"Sect Leader, the disciple stationed at the Abandoned Courtyard reported that the pagoda there exploded for some reason and has completely turned into ruins."
Story-part4_5_2,"That pagoda must not be as simple as it seems, it's a pity that there's no chance to investigate it anymore..."
Story-part5_1_1,"Reporting to the Sect Leader, ever since our sect took control of the Viburnum dew specialty of Qiongshan Forest, all the wine lovers in the sect are overjoyed, drinking good wine every day to relieve their worries."
Story-part5_1_2,"But in the past few days, the winery that cooperates with our sect has suddenly interrupted the supply of Viburnum dew, causing great dissatisfaction among the disciples."
Story-part5_1_3,"Although merchants are profit-driven, there's no reason to deceive our sect. There must be something hidden behind this, let's send someone to find out."
Story-part5_name,Shortage of Fine Wine
Story-part5_log,"The Qiongshan Forest winery has suddenly interrupted the supply of fine wine to your sect, you decide to find out why."
Story-part5_2_1,"Such a large winery, and you say there's no Viburnum dew? Is it because you, the cunning merchant, want to hoard and wait for the price to rise?"
Story-part5_2_2,"It's a misunderstanding! A few days ago, a Ragged Taoist who reeked of alcohol came to the door and asked for five jars of wine from the cellar."
Story-part5_2_3,"I explained repeatedly that although we have the wine, those five jars are reserved for your sect and cannot be sold. But the Taoist got angry when he heard this, pushed me aside, and rushed into the wine cellar..."
Story-part5_2_4,"I was afraid he would smash the wine in anger, so I followed him in pain, only to see the Ragged Taoist drink all five jars of Viburnum dew like a whale, then fell unconscious on the ground for three days..."
Story-part5_2_5,"So, the Taoist should still be passed out in the wine cellar."
Story-part5_2_6,"Indeed! I tried several times to throw him out, but I didn't expect that this Taoist, although drunk, could easily beat up my clerk..."
Story-part5_2_7,"This person has entered the Passive state through the wine, and is not someone ordinary people can stop. Let us handle it."
Story-part5_2_8,"You come to the wine cellar and find that the five jars of fine wine have indeed been drunk dry. A Ragged Taoist on the ground is holding a wine jar, mumbling some dreamy words."
Story-part5_2_9,"Laughing... in the wine, feasting... in the yellow..."
Story-part5_2_10,"Life... complete, pure yang... qi rushing..."
Story-part5_2_11,"God... wonderful use, Taoist law, burp... infinite Taoist law!"
Story-part5_2_12,The Ragged Taoist seems to have realized something and suddenly attacks with his eyes closed!
Story-part5_3_1,"This Ragged Taoist is really powerful, even though he's so drunk he's almost unconscious, he's still able to restrain me with every move..."
Story-part5_3_2,"I can't handle him alone, let him continue to pass out here."
Story-part5_4_1,真是好道人！好拳法！
Story-part5_4_2,唔……哪里来的好事徒，居然将道爷打醒……糟了，酒钱还未付，本道爷岂不是成了失信之人！
Story-part5_4_3,阁下就是Taoist Sect的La Tazhang张道长吧，久闻其名，今日终得一见！
Story-part5_4_4,道长所喝的那五坛Viburnum dew，权当记在本派账下。
Story-part5_4_5,孺子可教也~道爷Me也不白喝你的酒，此门拳法是这三日大醉意外悟出，就送给你折算酒钱吧！
Story-part5_4_6,这位La Tazhang果然是位武林奇人……不知道下次会在何处再见。
Story-part5_5_1,本掌门突然想起，那美酒短缺之事最后发展如何了？
Story-part5_5_2,回禀掌门，那家酒坊花费重金，从别处买来了五坛Viburnum dew送到门派，Disciple们也都没有怨言了。
Story-part5_5_3,这Viburnum dew怎会突然短缺，也是奇也怪哉……
Story-part6_1_1,掌门，近日有一群Great Ant City的EliteNinja潜入附近城镇，似乎在寻找La Tazhang的下落。
Story-part6_1_2,待到驻守Disciple应召赶去，这些Ninja又易容伪装，化整为零地躲藏起来。
Story-part6_1_3,这帮东瀛败类，定是趁着Taoist Sect灭亡要对张道长不利，待本掌门抽调几位精干Disciple，救援张道长。
Story-part6_name,再遇酒徒
Story-part6_log,你听闻一群Pifeng City Ninja要对La Tazhang不利，准备派人前去救援。
Story-part6_2_1,根据驻守Disciple的情报，此处酒馆就是张道长最后出现的地方。
Story-part6_2_2,奇怪，张道长所在之地应该异常危险才对……为何这里人来人往风平浪静，没有一点Pifeng City Ninja的影子呢？
Story-part6_2_3,{MyFaction}的大侠，外面风吹日晒，快来Me们酒馆坐坐吧，好酒好菜有的是！
Story-part6_2_4,区区一个酒馆小二，居然认识Me们的身份？
Story-part6_2_5,唉，估计张道长一听到“好酒”这两个字就上当了……
Story-part6_2_6,嘿，告诉你们两个死人也无妨。为了对付酒馆里的La Tazhang，Me们足足安排进去了十二个同伴。
Story-part6_2_7,上到慈眉善目的酒馆Innkeeper，下到熟悉信任的跑堂Clerk，就连楼上楼下那些正在猜拳吃酒的酒客，也都是Me们的人。
Story-part6_2_8,La Tazhang杀了Me们Great Ant City那么多人，今日必死无疑！
Story-part6_2_9,先送你们上路吧，正好和他凑一队枉死鬼！
Story-part6_3_1,这些人不愧是Great Ant City的EliteNinja，阴招频出，实在难以应付，只能另寻办法救援张道长了……
Story-part6_4_1,这些EliteNinja拖住了Me们大量时间，张道长以少敌多可能已经Stamina不支，快杀进客栈！
Story-part6_4_2,休要以众欺寡！有本事冲着……嗯？
Story-part6_4_3,"你二人忧心La Tazhang的安危，急匆匆地杀进客栈\n眼前的景象却根本超乎你们的意料……"
Story-part6_4_4,"不大的酒馆内，横七竖八的躺满了Ninja的尸体\nLa Tazhang斜躺在店内最后一张完好的桌子上\n醉眼迷离地举着一把四方酒壶\n朝着嘴里狠狠灌酒"
Story-part6_4_5,看来，张道长似乎并不需要Me们去救他……
Story-part6_4_6,突然有一种打扰了的错觉……打道回府吧。
Story-part6_4_7,"Hey... don't go... you know this Taoist master... didn't have enough fun fighting, and... sent two more up..."
Story-part6_4_8,In my life... I specialize in killing... hic... Japanese pirates!
Story-part6_4_9,"The more drunk this Taoist master Zhang gets, the better his kung fu, but it seems, he also can't tell people apart!"
Story-part6_4_10,"How much did he drink... with your strength, wake him up!"
Story-part6_5_1,"Taoist Zhang drank too much, we can't subdue him!"
Story-part6_5_2,"There's no way, look for an opportunity to escape!"
Story-part6_6_1,Huff... huff... huff...
Story-part6_6_2,"This Taoist master is thirsty, bring wine!"
Story-part6_6_3,"Taoist Zhang, you finally woke up, don't drink anymore!"
Story-part6_6_4,"Awake? When I'm drunk, I'm awake, and when I'm awake, I'm slowly getting drunk!"
Story-part6_6_5,"Awake is Tao, drunk is Tao, knowing is Tao, not knowing is Tao, I seek my own Tao... hey, it's all nonsense!"
Story-part6_6_6,"Although Taoist Zhang seems confused, he has already understood what the great Tao is..."
Story-part6_6_7,"Taoist, killing Japanese pirates is Tao, beating corrupt officials is Tao; playing finger-guessing games and drinking is Tao, Guardian of the Homeland is Tao. The Taoist Sect is gone, why don't you join our sect, guaranteeing you different Tao to comprehend every day."
Story-part6_6_8,Join your sect? Hmm...
Story-part6_6_9,"Taoist Zhang rest assured, our sect doesn't mention other Tao, but this wine Tao is unique!"
Story-part6_6_10,"Hey, it seems that this Taoist master must join!"
Story-part6_7_1,Sect leader... did you forget about saving Taoist Zhang...
Story-part6_7_2,"Oh my memory, it's too late to go to the rescue now, we can only hope that Taoist Zhang is blessed..."
Story-part7_1_1,"Recently, the sect has been busy, making me sore and cramping..."
Story-part7_1_2,"No, no, I can't go on like this, I have to find something interesting to combine work and rest."
Story-part7_1_3,"Sect leader, I heard that there is a strange Taoist priest who calls himself Jian Pin. He says he was born with a sword eye and can see the heart of every sword. If he gets it wrong, he will pay ten times the compensation."
Story-part7_1_4,"Oh? There's such a strange thing, I'll go and see it later."
Story-part7_name,"Courage of the sword, heart of the zither"
Story-part7_log,"You heard about a strange person who claims to be able to see the heart of the sword, and you plan to go and see it."
Story-part7_2_1,"I didn't expect that there would be so many curious people like me, who blocked the whole stall."
Story-part7_2_2,"I, Jian Pin, rely on a pair of sword eyes, specially came to your precious place to appraise the heart of the sword for you heroes."
Story-part7_2_3,"Hmph, what bullshit sword eye, it's obviously a swindler, don't be fooled, brothers."
Story-part7_2_4,"If you don't believe it, you can pay me a hundred coins to have a look. If I get it wrong, I'll pay ten times the compensation!"
Story-part7_2_5,"There are so many brothers around me, you dare not deny it! Come on, tell me what kind of sword heart this sword in my hand is?"
Story-part7_2_6,"Interesting, this sword looks grand and gorgeous, but the sword heart is old and rotten."
Story-part7_2_7,"If I guess right, this is a family heirloom. Your ancestors wanted you to inherit this sword and innovate, but you not only stick to the old ways, but also add a lot of superfluous decorations to the sword."
Story-part7_2_8,"I estimate that if you use it to fight with a first-class swordsman, it will break in three moves!"
Story-part7_2_9,"Hahaha! It's nonsense, pay me ten times the compensation!"
Story-part7_2_10,Two moves...
Story-part7_2_11,What two moves?
Story-part7_2_12,"The Taoist master overestimated this sword, it will break in two moves!"
Story-part7_2_13,Insult my family heirloom sword... looking for death!
Story-part7_2_14,"Dare to bully Eldest Brother, looking for death!"
Story-part7_2_15,"A group fight, huh? Let me, the sect leader, lend you a hand!"
Story-part7_3_1,"I didn't expect that both {Me} and this Sword One brother underestimated each other's strength, retreat quickly!"
Story-part7_4_1,"Two moves have passed, {Me} has other important matters and can't continue to play with you."
Story-part7_4_2,"Don't run after talking big, {Me}'s sword is just... what's going on? What kind of sorcery did you use!"
Story-part7_4_3,"As a swordsman, {Me} should be like his sword, and the sword should be like its master. You are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, so the sword you use is naturally just a decorative pillow. What's so surprising about it being broken by the great disciple of the Sword Pavilion in two moves."
Story-part7_4_4,"Taoist, {Me} is very curious about what kind of sword heart this Sword One brother has?"
Story-part7_4_5,"In my opinion, his sword heart is upright but not arrogant, sharp but not exposed, full but not floating, like having an ancient zither in his chest, the zither heart is the sword gall, waiting for the right time to strike."
Story-part7_4_6,"As long as he can calm down in the future and get rid of the last bit of youthful arrogance, he will definitely have a promising future."
Story-part7_4_7,"I have a sword technique here, I hope you can help me pass it on to him. Heaven has eyes, finally let me find a suitable person to entrust."
Story-part7_4_8,"Don't worry, Taoist, I'll take care of this."
Story-part7_4_9,"Langya Sword Pavilion has been destroyed, such a good talent should be used by our sect, looking forward to the next meeting."
Story-part7_5_1,"Phew... Finally finished all the work, take me to find that weird Taoist priest."
Story-part7_5_2,"Sect leader, you have been immersed in work for too long, that Taoist priest ran away from here a month ago..."
Story-part8_1_1,"Sect leader, recently it has been widely spread in the martial arts world that the young hero Dugu Jianyi has challenged several famous swordsmen in the martial arts world for some reason, and has agreed to fight to the death this month."
Story-part8_1_2,"This Dugu Jianyi is talented, but as Jian Pin Taoist said, he still has a bit of youthful arrogance."
Story-part8_1_3,"But having said that, if a person is not frivolous, he is in vain as a young man. Let me, the sect leader, help him again."
Story-part8_name,Youthful Arrogance
Story-part8_log,"Dugu Jianyi has challenged several famous swordsmen for some reason, and you are ready to get involved."
Story-part8_2_1,"My ScholarHead hunter sword must draw blood as soon as it comes out, Dugu Jianyi, remember that you forced me..."
Story-part8_2_2,"This bastard smashed all the fine wines in my cellar. If I don't pierce your heart with a sword, I won't be able to vent my anger!"
Story-part8_2_3,"I'll give you one last chance, go to my master's grave and kowtow to apologize immediately, admit that our sect's swordsmanship is far superior to the Sword Pavilion, otherwise..."
Story-part8_2_4,"Don't waste your breath with him, this kid has chopped up the inheritance plaque of our sect, we absolutely can't let him go today."
Story-part8_2_5,"Bashan Taoist, although your swordsmanship is good, your Songfeng Sword Sect is clearly a sect established by a wild fox Zen, but you dare to claim to be the source of swordsmanship, aren't you ashamed?"
Story-part8_2_6,"And you, Deadly Scholar, your master once told me that the ScholarHead hunter sword is Yin outside and Yang inside, Iron Fist Velvet Glove, which is in line with the honorable spirit of scholars who are unyielding."
Story-part8_2_7,"But now in your hands, there is only Yin and no Yang, leaving a gentle taste of a small family jade, I just reminded you a few words, why are you so angry?"
Story-part8_2_8,"The remaining two, both are more fake fame than real skill, if you have any objections, don't be polite, come on together!"
Story-part8_2_9,"Brothers, don't talk about any martial arts ethics when dealing with this devil, let's kill this guy together!"
Story-part8_2_10,"Although these people were criticized by Sword One brother and were ashamed, they still have some real skills, we can't just sit back and watch..."
Story-part8_2_11,"Another group fight, huh? Let me, the sect leader, lend you a hand again!"
Story-part8_3_1,"These swordsmen are all quite skilled, if the fight continues, accidents are bound to happen, I can't help Sword One Brothers anymore..."
Story-part8_4_1,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, it's you again..."
Story-part8_4_2,"Sword One Brothers, these people's swordsmanship may not have reached the realm of perfection, but each has their own extraordinary aspects. You challenged four in a row, are you out of your mind or just desperate!"
Story-part8_4_3,"Neither, I just want to retrace the old path of my master's swordsmanship. I want to prove that although the Sword Pavilion has been destroyed, the inheritance of seeking the sword with all one's heart is passed on!"
Story-part8_4_4,"Since you ruined my big plan, I'll use you as a stepping stone in my pursuit of the sword,"
Story-part8_5_1,"You are simply untrained in the way of the sword, we have different paths and do not seek the same ends, farewell!"
Story-part8_6_1,"I didn't expect {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader to understand the sword so well, fighting with you is far better than fighting a hundred battles with mediocrities."
Story-part8_6_2,"I, the Sect Leader, admire you greatly, join {MyFaction}, I can practice the sword with you at any time, you don't have to provoke others anymore."
Story-part8_6_3,"You said it, let's have three more matches now!"
Story-part8_6_4,"Sword One Brother, you have to let me, the Sect Leader, have a meal first..."
Story-part8_7_1,"Sect Leader, Dugu Jianyi and those four or five swordsmen fought fiercely, and they all disappeared..."
Story-part8_7_2,"Alas, we can only pray for the blessings of Sword One Brothers..."
Story-part9_1_1,"I heard that there is a melodious sound of music coming from the Refugee Camp, which makes the refugees lose their appetite and become infatuated. What's going on?"
Story-part9_1_2,"Reporting to the Sect Leader, it seems that a woman is performing for the refugees in public, but I don't know why."
Story-part9_1_3,"It's really a pity that the businesswoman doesn't know the sorrow of the country, and she still sings the backyard flowers across the river..."
Story-part9_1_4,"These refugees are all poor people who have lost their homes in the north, and there are still people who want to disturb their minds. I will go and see for myself later!"
Story-part9_name,Melodious Sound
Story-part9_log,A woman is causing a disturbance in the Refugee Camp by publicly performing. You decide to go and stop her yourself.
Story-part9_2_1,"You storm into the gates of the Refugee Camp in a huff\nThe surrounding scene is quite shocking\nThe sound of the lute in the air is calm and elegant, filled with a heartwarming magic\nThe Refugees are not only not intoxicated, but are in Good spirits\nEither working hard under the comfort of the lute\nOr fantasizing about life after returning to their homeland..."
Story-part9_2_2,It seems that I was deceived by jealous people... This girl is just using the sound of the piano to express her feelings and heal the pain of the refugees being away from their homeland.
Story-part9_2_3,"Such a wonderful sound of nature, really makes me miss the time when I was still at home..."
Story-part9_2_4,"My lost son should still be alive somewhere, maybe he even has a baby now..."
Story-part9_2_5,"Fellow villagers, Qincheng will run away from here later, and I want to play a few more songs while there is still a little time left."
Story-part9_2_6,"Miss Qincheng, your hands must be sore from playing the piano for so long, come down and rest for a while."
Story-part9_2_7,"Qincheng has been with the piano since she was a child, as long as she can bring strength to everyone, no matter how long she plays, she will not be tired."
Story-part9_2_8,"Eh? It's {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, why are you here..."
Story-part9_2_9,"This is the territory of my sect, {PlayerSurName} can come here of course, on the contrary, Miss Qincheng, you are the one who came uninvited haha~"
Story-part9_2_10,"After the fall of Melody House, Gu Qingcheng originally planned to travel overseas to study foreign instruments, but when she passed by the Refugee Camp, she saw these pitiful people who were sad because they had to leave their homes."
Story-part9_2_11,"Gu Qingcheng couldn't bear to see their suffering, so she played a song called ""Dancing Butterfly Over Skyline"" to soothe their pain, which unexpectedly became very popular."
Story-part9_2_12,"In order not to disappoint everyone, she decided to stay a few more days... Gu Qingcheng will leave now, promising not to cause any trouble for your faction."
Story-part9_op_1_1,Support Gu Qingcheng
Story-part9_op_1_2,Retain Gu Qingcheng
Story-part9_3_1,"There's no need to worry about bothering or not bothering, if Miss Gu Qingcheng has the heart to study abroad, let the head of this faction send you off."
Story-part9_3_2,"When Gu Qingcheng returns from her studies, she will definitely visit your faction. This music score can be considered as an apology for my two visits."
Story-part9_4_1,"These refugees were depressed all day long, but now they are calm and satisfied. Is this the power of music..."
Story-part9_4_2,"Miss Gu Qingcheng, why don't you stay here? Your music will definitely be a great help to comfort the people!"
Story-part9_4_3,"Gu Qingcheng really wants to join your faction, but she can't betray her ideals..."
Story-part9_4_4,"How about this, when Gu Qingcheng returns from her studies, she will definitely visit your faction. This music score can be considered as an apology for my two visits."
Story-part9_5_1,"Leader, the girl who performed at the Refugee Camp suddenly left, and we don't know where she went."
Story-part9_5_2,"It's good that such a person who disturbs the people's minds has left, so the leader doesn't have to worry about it."
Story-part10_1_1,"Leader, Miss Gu Qingcheng suddenly came to visit."
Story-part10_1_2,"I didn't expect Miss Gu Qingcheng to return from abroad so soon, I wonder if her studies went smoothly?"
Story-part10_name,Gu Qingcheng visits
Story-part10_log,Gu Qingcheng returns from her overseas journey and visits your faction.
Story-part10_2_1,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, Gu Qingcheng greets you~"
Story-part10_2_2,"Miss Gu Qingcheng, it's been a long time. Was your overseas study journey as smooth as you imagined?"
Story-part10_2_3,"Although it was different from what Gu Qingcheng thought, overall it was smooth. I wonder if {PlayerSurName} leader has the leisure to listen to what Gu Qingcheng saw and thought on the way?"
Story-part10_2_4,"Miss Gu Qingcheng, just say it, I will definitely listen attentively!"
Story-part10_2_5,"My first stop after going out to sea was the country of Xinji, which is good at playing the Gayageum."
Story-part10_2_6,"This instrument is said to be made by imitating the Guzheng of our country, with one string and one pillar, but with a wider range and louder volume."
Story-part10_2_7,"Xinji is weak, and the king often has to fuel war with warfare to protect himself, but he loses more than he wins. Therefore, the people of Xinji often play this instrument to express their sorrow for the country, which is sad and melodious, but also long and melodious."
Story-part10_2_8,I didn't expect that there would be such a lamentable story behind an instrument...
Story-part10_2_9,"Gu Qingcheng wants to ask {PlayerSurName} leader, how do you view the choice of this king of Xinji?"
Story-part10_op_1_1,"Better to be a broken jade than a complete tile, he has done his best"
Story-part10_op_1_2,"For his own honor and disgrace, he just forced the people"
Story-part10_3_1,"As the saying goes, it's better to be a broken jade than a complete tile. From the king's point of view, he has done his best and left the rest to fate."
Story-part10_3_2,"I see, Gu Qingcheng understands..."
Story-part10_4_1,"This choice is just to preserve his own honor and face, forcing the people to suffer."
Story-part10_4_2,"Such relentless warfare, if defeated, needless to say, even if victorious, what's the point? Countless resources are wasted on armaments, and the people are still not clothed and fed properly."
Story-part10_4_3,"Qingcheng shares the same view with the head of {PlayerSurName}, as Han Feizi once said: ""A small country that does not humble itself, a weak country that does not fear the strong, is doomed to perish."""
Story-part10_4_4,"In the end, this new king of Jixi is just unwilling to bear the responsibility of the country's demise, but he didn't realize that his actions would only hasten the downfall of the nation."
Story-part10_5_1,"After that, Qingcheng continued her journey westward and arrived in Ryukyu."
Story-part10_5_2,"There is a musical instrument here called the Shamisen, which is said to have been invented by a blind artist."
Story-part10_5_3,"The biggest feature of this instrument is that it doesn't need tuning, it can be played improvisationally, and it can even be used as a drum by striking the body of the instrument with a plectrum."
Story-part10_5_4,"It is said that the blind artist once bet with a rich man using the Shamisen, that if he could play continuously for three days and nights without rest, his son could have a bowl of white rice."
Story-part10_5_5,Qingcheng has a question and hopes that the head of {PlayerSurName} can help answer it.
Story-part10_5_6,"Although white rice is not readily available in my Zhao country, it is not a rare commodity. Why did the blind artist go to such lengths just to let his son taste rice?"
Story-part10_op_2_1,The artist is blind and cannot discern the quality of food.
Story-part10_op_2_2,The son is picky and insists on eating the rice from the general's house.
Story-part10_op_2_3,The wise king determines the value based on the country's situation.
Story-part10_6_1,"It must be that the old artist is blind, his cognition is reversed since childhood, and he cannot discern the quality of food."
Story-part10_6_2,"I see, Gu Qingcheng understands..."
Story-part10_7_1,"It must be that the son is picky, does not appreciate his father's hard work, and insists on eating the rice from the rich man's house."
Story-part10_7_2,"I see, Gu Qingcheng understands..."
Story-part10_8_1,"It must be that the wise king, knowing that the country's agriculture is backward, deliberately inflated the value of grain to attract the people to plant widely."
Story-part10_8_2,"Exactly! Ryukyu is surrounded by sea and mountains, relying on the sea for food but lacking in grain. Once the luck is bad and the sea products are short, many people starve to death."
Story-part10_8_3,"The king of Ryukyu does not want the people to rely solely on the grace of God for food and not know how to farm, so he tries to raise the price of grain to encourage the people to reclaim wasteland, and ultimately save as many people as possible during the famine."
Story-part10_9_1,"After studying in these two countries, Qingcheng suddenly felt homesick and returned to Zhao country."
Story-part10_10_1,"The question Qingcheng just asked is not only an impression from the journey, but also a presumptuous test of the character of the head of {PlayerSurName}..."
Story-part10_10_2,"Unexpectedly, the head of {PlayerSurName} is not only a martial arts master, but also a virtuous person who cares about the common people. What's more rare is that it completely aligns with what I think..."
Story-part10_10_3,"Qingcheng is determined to join {MyFaction}, and hopes that the head of {PlayerSurName} will fulfill her wish!"
Story-part10_10_4,"I didn't expect that Miss Qingcheng is not only stunningly beautiful, but also has such an orchid heart, worrying about the country and the people!"
Story-part10_10_5,"From now on, you are a part of my {MyFaction}!"
Story-part10_11_1,"Head of {PlayerSurName}, Qingcheng is feeling a bit tired for some reason..."
Story-part10_11_2,"These are some exotic specialties I brought back, Qingcheng will go back to rest today, please forgive me."
Story-part10_11_3,"Miss Qingcheng, you must be tired from the journey, go back and rest first!"
Story-part10_12_1,"Head, Miss Qingcheng comes to our sect every day to ask if you are busy, today is the first day she didn't come."
Story-part10_12_2,"Damn, I actually neglected the beauty, help me find her back quickly!"
Story-part11_1_1,"Head, an auction house named Rimobang sent an invitation, inviting our sect to participate."
Story-part11_1_2,"Strange, the Night Auction Market has already been destroyed, how come there is another Sun Mo Fang, send someone to check it out."
Story-part11_name,Owner of Sun Mo Fang
Story-part11_log,"After the destruction of the Night Auction Market, a new Sun Mo Fang has appeared and invites you to attend the auction."
Story-part11_2_1,"What a crappy Sun Mo Fang... It's simply set up in a civilian house, without a single bodyguard, it doesn't have half the style of the old Night Auction Market!"
Story-part11_2_2,"You must be from {MyFaction}, I am Shen Wuqi, the owner of Sun Mo Fang, nice to meet you!"
Story-part11_2_3,"Brother Shen... We have not only met, but also fought several times..."
Story-part11_2_4,"Ah? Really, I guess I must have had another bout of amnesia. But it doesn't matter, no matter what happened before, today you are all my honored guests!"
Story-part11_2_5,"After the destruction of the Night Auction Market, almost all the clerks and goods were lost, I had to take the remaining three treasures and go far away, ready to sell at a low price."
Story-part11_2_6,"In order to raise funds for a comeback, I plan to auction these three treasures publicly, the highest bidder wins."
Story-part11_2_7,"Unlike before, this time it's a thrilling blind auction, I will hide the treasures in a box and give a description, please bid according to your judgment."
Story-part11_2_8,"The first treasure is a round spherical object, it seems to have a faint fragrance, the starting price is 1000 coins."
Story-part11_2_9,"Ladies and gentlemen, according to my experience, this is a common small pill, don't fall for such a low-level trick."
Story-part11_2_10,"Still Small pill... Let me tell you, these foreigners have bad consciences, deliberately vague words let you imagine. Round, and fragrant, ha! Be careful, 1000 Coin for a Candied fruit!"
Story-part11_2_11,"Shen Wuqi is indeed too vague, if he cheats, no one can do anything about it, should I bid?"
Story-part11_op_1_1,I bid 1100 coins!
Story-part11_op_1_2,Refuse to bid
Story-part11_3_1,"When Shen Wuqi opened the Night Auction Market, he always used sincerity as his trademark, trust him once, I bid 1100 coins!"
Story-part11_3_2,"Once, twice, three times! Congratulations on winning the treasure, please check it yourself."
Story-part11_3_3,"Let me see, it turns out to be a high-quality Dzi bead, not bad at all!"
Story-part11_3_4,Eh... How did I misjudge it?
Story-part11_3_5,"Hmph, this must be the bait he threw out to lure us into the game, and then cheat a big one later."
Story-part11_4_1,"So many people doubt him, it seems not without reason, I won't bid."
Story-part11_5_1,"Okay, let's look at the second treasure. This is a neatly shaped jade pendant, it feels cool to the touch, the color is beautiful, the starting price is 3000 coins."
Story-part11_5_2,"I've been playing with antiques for ten years, this kind of thing is a common ""GONG"" inscripted jade ornament, what color, it's actually just mixed color."
Story-part11_5_3,"As for the cool feeling, it's more of a common saying among you unscrupulous merchants, jade itself is not heat-conductive, if you have the ability, find a hot jade pendant!"
Story-part11_5_4,"No one is bidding, everyone seems to agree with the merchant's words, should I bid..."
Story-part11_op_2_1,I bid 3100 coins!
Story-part11_op_2_2,Refuse to bid
Story-part11_6_1,"I believe in Shen Wuqi's business principles, he can't possibly knockoff, I bid 3100 coins!"
Story-part11_6_2,"Once, twice, three times! Congratulations on winning the treasure, please check it yourself."
Story-part11_6_3,"Let me see, it turns out to be a rare Cold gem, big profit!"
Story-part11_6_4,Impossible! How can this quality of Cold gem start at 3000 Coin?
Story-part11_7_1,"What that Merchant said makes sense, Shen Wuqi's Sincere is just a facade, I won't bid anymore."
Story-part11_8_1,"The first two treasures have been auctioned off, this third one..."
Story-part11_8_2,"What exactly is this third treasure... stop keeping us in suspense, it's so frustrating!"
Story-part11_8_3,"Master Shen, I was just being suspicious earlier, please bring out the third treasure!"
Story-part11_8_4,"This third treasure is me, Shen Wuqi."
Story-part11_8_5,"Master Shen, you must be joking! Who would auction themselves..."
Story-part11_8_6,"This is no joke, the most precious thing in the Night Auction Market in the past was not any treasure or antique, but my Shen Wuqi's ""Sincere, genuine"" reputation."
Story-part11_8_7,"Whoever wins me, Shen Wuqi, will have the right to command me.\nThe starting price is..."
Story-part11_9_1,The starting price is 1 Coin!
Story-part11_9_2,"But only {PlayerName} is eligible to bid, because you are the only one in the room who chose to trust me."
Story-part11_9_3,"I'll bid this one Coin, our sect welcomes Master Shen's joining!"
Story-part11_9_4,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader is generous, this Celestial Star Manual is a small gift for buying me."
Story-part11_10_1,The starting price is 6000 Coin!
Story-part11_10_2,"Shen Wuqi is quite powerful, his price was quickly driven up, it's estimated that it will take 10000 Coin to win..."
Story-part11_op_3_1,Shen Wuqi is not worth this price
Story-part11_op_3_2,Just a mere 10000 Coin
Story-part11_11_1,"Shen Wuqi, although he was once a master of a sect, is not worth this price. All three treasures have been seen, let's go home."
Story-part11_12_1,"Just a mere 10000 Coin, buying such a master, it's not a loss."
Story-part11_12_2,"I'll bid this 10000 Coin, our sect welcomes Master Shen's joining!"
Story-part11_12_3,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader is generous, this Celestial Star Manual is a small gift for buying me."
Story-part11_13_1,"Leader, the Day Mo Sect that invited you suddenly disappeared without a trace."
Story-part11_13_2,"It's good that we didn't go, it was indeed a scam!"
Story-part12_1_1,"Leader, Young Master Cai from the Confucius Temple has sent a letter, please take a look."
Story-part12_1_2,"So this young master wants to become the Confucius Temple's junior Dojokeeper, asking me to help him break the Four Sages Formation, saying there will be a big reward."
Story-part12_1_3,"Although the relations between the two sects are good, considering Cai Dojokeeper's likes and dislikes, the leader should think it over."
Story-part12_name,Four Sages Formation
Story-part12_log,"Cai Youzhi sent you a letter, asking you to help him break the Four Sages Formation in the temple."
Story-part12_2_1,"{PlayerSurName} Brother, you are indeed trustworthy, I didn't expect you to come!"
Story-part12_2_2,"Can Brother Cai tell me, what does this matter of becoming the junior Dojokeeper have to do with breaking this formation?"
Story-part12_2_3,"Although I was designated as the next Dojokeeper of the Confucius Temple by my father since birth, both my experience and martial arts are hard to convince others. To gain recognition within the Confucius Temple, one must break through the Four Sages Formation in the temple."
Story-part12_2_4,"As long as {PlayerSurName} Brother is willing to help break this formation, I will definitely reward you heavily!"
Story-part12_2_5,"Understood, lead the way."
Story-part12_2_6,"{PlayerSurName} Brother, we have entered the formation, this formation is guarded by four wise men of our sect, please be careful!"
Story-part12_3_1,"This formation is not to be underestimated, I don't expect to succeed in one go."
Story-part12_3_2,"Sigh... Even if I fail to break the formation and can't become the junior Dojokeeper, when can I finally go outside the Confucius Temple..."
Story-part12_4_1,"Successfully broke through the formation, Me can finally go to see the places outside the Confucius Temple!"
Story-part12_4_2,"Thanks to the help of {PlayerSurName} brother this time, this Manual is a token of my gratitude. If there is any need for Cai in the future, I will not refuse!"
Story-part12_5_1,"Leader, Young Master Cai has sent another letter, saying that the person who can break the formation has been found, so you don't need to bother anymore."
Story-part12_5_2,"That's good, so the leader doesn't have to make another trip."
Story-part12_6_1,"Leader, the Confucius Temple has suddenly been destroyed, I'm afraid your plan to help Young Master Cai can't be realized..."
Story-part12_6_2,"It's fate, I hope he can take care of himself."
Story-part13_1_1,"Leader, the former Confucius Temple's young Dojokeeper Cai Youzhi is now wandering around the world, and I heard that he just found a job as a teacher."
Story-part13_1_2,"Alas, the once great Confucius Temple is now scattered, send someone to check on him."
Story-part13_name,Honorable Unworthy
Story-part13_log,Cai Youzhi seems to have found a job as a teacher after the destruction of the Confucius Temple.
Story-part13_2_1,This should be the private school where Cai Youzhi is.
Story-part13_2_2,"From the high-ranking young Dojokeeper of the Confucius Temple to a common teacher, I didn't expect Brother Cai to not be discouraged."
Story-part13_2_3,"Enter the path of Honorable, to learn the conduct of Honorable."
Story-part13_2_4,"Enter the path of Honorable, to learn the conduct of Honorable..."
Story-part13_2_5,"He is indeed teaching these children with all his heart, not wasting the Honorable spirit of the Confucius Temple."
Story-part13_2_6,"To be a scholar is to seek the path of Honorable, those who succeed and reach are in the state of unworthiness."
Story-part13_2_7,"To be a scholar is to seek the path of Honorable, those who succeed and..."
Story-part13_2_8,"Don't rush, this sentence is indeed difficult to read, follow Me slowly: those who succeed and reach are in..."
Story-part13_2_9,"Teacher Cai, behind you... Ah! Teacher Cai is injured!"
Story-part13_2_10,"Hmph... So it's the scum of the rivers and lakes who bears a grudge against Me Confucius Temple and is ready to take a chance, if you want to assassinate Cai, why do it in front of innocent children!"
Story-part13_2_11,"Young Master Cai, let Me lend you a hand."
Story-part13_3_1,Teacher Cai... Teacher Cai... don't die!
Story-part13_3_2,"We were delayed too long by the Man in black, and it was too late to save Young Master Cai..."
Story-part13_4_1,Cai is grateful for your great help...
Story-part13_4_2,"Young Master Cai, don't be polite, this is what Me should do."
Story-part13_4_3,"The Confucius Temple has been destroyed, if Young Master Cai has nowhere to go, why not come to our sect for a while."
Story-part13_4_4,"When the Confucius Temple was destroyed, Cai was secretly sent out by his father. Because he didn't understand the dangers of the world, he suffered a lot. Fortunately, when I was about to give up, I was found and taken in by the villagers here."
Story-part13_4_5,"This village was suffering from a drought, but they were willing to lend a hand to Cai, a stranger."
Story-part13_4_6,"Moved by their kindness, Cai decided to teach the children the classics of Confucianism as a way to repay their kindness."
Story-part13_4_7,"If your sect is willing to accept Cai, I would be more than happy, but I would like to ask your sect to lend some food to the village to help them through the drought."
Story-part13_op_1_1,Our sect has always put the people first (2000 food)
Story-part13_op_1_2,"Our sect is short of food, I'm sorry we can't help"
Story-part13_5_1,"Our sect has always put the people first, we will transport food from our sect to this place immediately, to ensure that the people here can survive this disaster."
Story-part13_5_2,"Cai thanks you all, {MyFaction} really has the spirit of Honorable!"
Story-part13_6_1,"Our sect is barely able to help ourselves, I hope Young Master Cai can understand."
Story-part13_6_2,"As long as the disaster in the village is not resolved, Cai cannot leave this place, let's talk about joining your sect later."
Story-part13_7_1,"Young Master Cai was teaching in a private school to avoid the world, but he was still attacked by his enemies and his whereabouts are unknown."
Story-part13_7_2,"It's a pity that I've wasted too much time, otherwise I could definitely recruit this Coin-like gentleman into my sect..."
Story-part14_1_1,"Sect Leader, Master Hua Yan from Shifa Temple is visiting our sect."
Story-part14_1_2,"I have long heard that {PlayerSurName} is a talented person, and it is indeed extraordinary to see you today."
Story-part14_1_3,I came here this time because I heard that a thief who stole the Scripture from our temple was spotted on your sect's territory. I would like to ask {PlayerSurName} to help me catch this thief.
Story-part14_1_4,"Master, please rest for a while, I will send a Disciple to accompany you later."
Story-part14_name,Vajra Exorcist
Story-part14_log,Master Hua Yan came to ask for your help in tracking down the thief who stole the Scripture.
Story-part14_2_1,The mansion ahead should be the last place where the thief appeared.
Story-part14_2_2,"Amitabha, I really don't know how to repay your sect for your assistance."
Story-part14_2_3,"Master Hua Yan, you're too polite. I heard that you spend all day studying Buddhism in the Scripture Tower and never leave the temple. Why did you come to our sect today?"
Story-part14_2_4,The reason why I never left the temple before was to atone for an old mistake.
Story-part14_2_5,"Years ago, I trusted the wrong person, which led to him sneaking into the Scripture Tower and stealing the Valuable Sutra. As a punishment, I was ordered by the abbot to guard the Scripture Tower for the rest of my life."
Story-part14_2_6,"I see, but as long as you retrieve the Scripture, I don't think the abbot will blame you too much."
Story-part14_2_7,"Alas, actually, compared to retrieving the Valuable Sutra, what I care more about is catching that thief..."
Story-part14_2_8,"Where did this bald monk come from, daring to invade Zhao Laoye's mansion!"
Story-part14_2_9,Zhao Laoye has ordered that anyone who enters without permission will be killed without mercy!
Story-part14_2_10,"Such a domineering killing intent, if you are a bloody villain, don't blame me for being a Vajra Exorcist!"
Story-part14_2_11,I didn't expect this place to be a rich man's mansion. Let's get rid of these fierce Guardians first!
Story-part14_3_1,"These villains are extremely vicious, I will risk my life to stop them, you guys go!"
Story-part14_3_2,"Master Hua Yan is fighting to the death to give us a chance, let's go!"
Story-part14_4_1,"This is outrageous, you not only broke into my Residential house, but also killed and injured my Guardians, I will report you to the authorities!"
Story-part14_4_2,"These Guardians are not only fierce, but also have a stench of Robber baron. I wonder if the government will come to Info, whether they will catch me and the master, or Zhao Laoye who harbors bandits?"
Story-part14_4_3,……
Story-part14_4_4,"Let's talk it out, there must be a big misunderstanding..."
Story-part14_4_5,"Zhao, have you recently had a noble Yan man as a guest in your house?"
Story-part14_4_6,"So you came for him, I'm really wronged! That Yan man somehow found out that I was dealing in stolen goods, and forced me to buy and sell several Buddhist scriptures, and then disappeared."
Story-part14_4_7,"The scriptures are here, I hope you can let me go."
Story-part14_4_8,"Amitabha, although I haven't solved the big knot in my heart, at least finding the scriptures can give the abbot an explanation. This Dharma Staff is a token of my gratitude."
Story-part14_5_1,"Sect Leader, Master Hua Yan is so anxious waiting for you that he went to chase the thief who stole the Scripture by himself."
Story-part14_5_2,"Master Hua Yan is also impatient, can't he wait a little longer..."
Story-part15_1_1,"Sect Leader, Master Hua Yan was nowhere to be found after Shifa Temple was destroyed, but he suddenly appeared in an inn today, and it seems that he is going to be a Vajra Exorcist again."
Story-part15_1_2,"Master Hua Yan has chosen to re-enter the martial world, he must have found the trace of that Yan's son again."
Story-part15_name,A moment of difference
Story-part15_log,"Master Hua Yan suddenly appeared, he must have found the trace of the person who is his heart knot again."
Story-part15_2_1,"You, this Wolf, are ambitious and deliberately set up a trap... to ambush me..."
Story-part15_2_2,"Isn't it because you, this old bald donkey, are haunting everywhere, chasing after my son?"
Story-part15_2_3,"Master Hua Yan, Shifa Temple is gone, and you are still persistently chasing after me, you must have got the wrong end of the stick, right?"
Story-part15_2_4,"Back then, I made a mistake... not only did I regard you as half a Disciple, but I also taught you all my life's learning, and as a result, I caused such a big mess..."
Story-part15_2_5,"Wanyan Liang... I hate you for stealing the Scripture, and I hate you even more for using your skills to help the tiger..."
Story-part15_2_6,Let me solve the mistakes I made by myself!
Story-part15_2_7,"Master Hua Yan... you are already wounded and dying, don't be boastful."
Story-part15_2_8,"In consideration of the grace of teaching, I will not kill you, you go,"
Story-part15_2_9,"Unless you kill me yourself, otherwise I will chase to the ends of the earth, slay demons... and eliminate demons..."
Story-part15_2_10,"In that case, let me send the master to see the Buddha haha!"
Story-part15_2_11,"Not good, the master is in danger!"
Story-part15_3_1,"These two Yan people are highly skilled in martial arts, they can't take care of Master Hua Yan, let's retreat first..."
Story-part15_4_1,"Humph, let's go..."
Story-part15_4_2,"The master has been seriously injured, quickly send him back to the sect to heal!"
Story-part15_4_3,"After resting for many days, Master Hua Yan finally recovered his health\nUpon learning that you successfully repelled Wanyan Liang\nHe sighed deeply and voluntarily asked to join your sect"
Story-part15_5_1,"Leader, Master Hua Yan disappeared again after appearing in the inn..."
Story-part15_5_2,"Alas, it's all because I, the leader, have too many affairs, so I couldn't help the master..."
Story-part16_1_1,"Leader, a San Hua cat adopted by our sect ran out for some reason, and it is said to have gone into the Forest of Broken Souls."
Story-part16_1_2,"This cat is deeply loved by the disciples, we have to send someone to find it back."
Story-part16_name,Beast Talker
Story-part16_log,The San Hua cat adopted by the sect ran out and went into the dangerous Forest of Broken Souls.

Story-part16_2_3,Mimi? Mimi?
Story-part16_2_4,(Happy) Meow? Meow?
Story-part16_2_5,So you're here!
Story-part16_2_6,Howl!
Story-part16_2_7,"Wait, why are there a few wild wolves behind you!\nI'll deal with them, Mimi, you run towards me quickly!"
Story-part16_3_1,Howl!
Story-part16_3_2,"These beasts are familiar with the terrain, there is no need to entangle with them, let's take San Hua back to the sect first."
Story-part16_3_3,(Sad) Meow...
Story-part16_4_1,(Shocked) Meow...
Story-part16_4_2,"Are you crazy, little one? If it wasn't for me coming in time, you would have been eaten by the wild wolves!"
Story-part16_4_3,"Since you are here to find a cat, you must be a person who likes animals, but why did you hurt my friend?"
Story-part16_4_4,Eh? How did a gentle and elegant woman suddenly appear?
Story-part16_4_5,"Miss, you've confused me, I've never seen your friend, where did this talk of hurting people come from?"
Story-part16_4_6,"No need to quibble, I have my own way to confirm."
Story-part16_4_7,"Meow, meow meow meow?"
Story-part16_4_8,"(Torn) Meow, meow meow meow..."
Story-part16_4_9,"I have confirmed from the witness, it is you, the villain, who hurt several wild wolf friends, you have offended me!"
Story-part16_4_10,"Being able to talk directly to a cat, this is too unreasonable..."
Story-part16_5_1,"This lady's swordsmanship is extremely sharp, a slight carelessness will result in death under her sword..."
Story-part16_5_2,"The kitten has been found, let's hurry back to the sect."
Story-part16_6_1,"Miss, please stop, you are no match for me."
Story-part16_6_2,"I am Tang Wan Er from Beast Manor, I admit defeat, I will come back another day for guidance..."
Story-part16_6_3,"Wait, why would San Hua come here, why are those Wild Wolves your friends, could you please explain?"
Story-part16_6_4,"Beast Manor has the art of beast language, which allows us to communicate with various animals."
Story-part16_6_5,"After the manor was ruined, I took these two Wild Wolf friends to wander around the world, looking for a place to stay, and unexpectedly met this San Hua friend who gets lost every day."
Story-part16_6_6,"Because I was worried that it was not familiar with the forest path, I specially sent two Wild Wolf friends to send it out, but I didn't expect to be misunderstood by the young hero and got beaten up, it seems that I didn't consider it thoroughly..."
Story-part16_6_7,"I see, since Miss Tang has nowhere to stay for the time being, why not join our sect?"
Story-part16_6_8,"Many disciples in our sect like animals, but they don't know the proper way to raise them, Miss Tang can just guide them."
Story-part16_6_9,"Then I will bother you, this sword book is a compensation for the misunderstanding..."
Story-part16_7_1,"Master, that San Hua ran back by itself, it's dirty and seems to have lost some weight."
Story-part16_7_2,"It's lucky to be alive, keep a closer eye on it in the future."
Story-part17_1_1,"Master, do you remember Kong Yidao, the leader of Blue Wind Camp?"
Story-part17_1_2,"Of course I remember, this brute has repeatedly provoked our sect, and ended up humiliating himself, why do you suddenly mention him?"
Story-part17_1_3,"I heard that after the destruction of Blue Wind Camp, Kong Yidao seemed to have repented and lived in a small village."
Story-part17_1_4,"But recently, for some reason, he suddenly started recruiting old members and buying horses, and even fenced off the village."
Story-part17_1_5,"There is such a thing, we can't let him harm the villagers again, I will go there myself!"
Story-part17_name,Incorrigible

Story-part17_2_2,"Okay, Boss Kong!"
Story-part17_2_3,"Boss Kong, look ahead, that, that person is here again!"
Story-part17_2_4,"Hey, long time no see~"
Story-part17_2_5,{PlayerName}? What are you doing here!
Story-part17_2_6,"Heaven has the virtue of good life, when I broke Blue Wind Camp, I did not relentlessly pursue and assassinate you."
Story-part17_2_7,"Thinking that you are incorrigible and are rebuilding the stronghold here, this time I will definitely not let you go!"
Story-part17_2_8,"Just do it, don't think I'm really afraid of you!"
Story-part17_3_1,"Did Kong Yidao have any adventures, why is he suddenly so powerful..."
Story-part17_3_2,"{PlayerName} you go, you spared me a horse, I am not an ungrateful person."
Story-part17_4_1,"I thought you had made progress, but it turns out that you are still at the same level as before."
Story-part17_4_2,"The ancients said: those who are incorrigible should be punished, do you have any last words to say?"
Story-part17_4_3,"I have nothing to say, kill or slaughter, I will listen to your orders!"
Story-part17_4_4,"Okay, then let me..."
Story-part17_op_1_1,Act immediately to eliminate future troubles
Story-part17_op_1_2,"Something is strange, don't act rashly"
Story-part17_5_1,This time I won't let the tiger return to the mountain.
Story-part17_5_2,"General Yang, I, Kong Yidao, am a good man again after eighteen years..."
Story-part17_6_1,"Your reaction is strange, don't worry, I won't act rashly before I confirm the situation."
Story-part17_6_2,Hmph... How annoying...
Story-part17_6_3,"Brother Kong, the villagers have hidden the food as you instructed. Huh? Who are you, villain? Let go of Brother Kong!"
Story-part17_6_4,Me? A villain? Are you sure you're not mistaken?
Story-part17_6_5,"Mistaken? Our village has been repeatedly taxed by the government. If we don't pay, they kill the innocent and loot the people. If it weren't for Brother Kong moving into the village and fighting with the soldiers, they would have dug our village three feet deep!"
Story-part17_6_6,"Those corrupt officials hate Brother Kong, who stands up for the righteous, to the bone. They vowed to gather soldiers and horses to wipe out our village."
Story-part17_6_7,"Upon hearing the news, Brother Kong called his old friends to help build fences for the village and taught us how to hide food in preparation for the worst."
Story-part17_6_8,"You say you're not a villain, so is Brother Kong a villain?"
Story-part17_6_9,"In that case, it seems that our sect has misunderstood..."
Story-part17_6_10,"Kong Yidao, when are those soldiers likely to return?"
Story-part17_6_11,In about three months.
Story-part17_6_12,"Alright, you stay in the village and build fortifications. Our sect will come to assist when the time comes."
Story-part17_6_13,"Wait, don't leave yet..."
Story-part17_6_14,"You're really something. You're decisive when doing bad things, but why are you so hesitant when doing good things?"
Story-part17_6_15,"This book of Mang Cang Jue is my family's martial arts, if I die here in three months, please carry it on for me..."
Story-part17_7_1,"Master, the small village where Kong Yidao is located has been attacked by soldiers. I'm afraid it's been completely leveled."
Story-part17_7_2,"It's only natural for soldiers to suppress bandits, but it's a pity for those villagers who were killed..."
Story-part18_1_1,"Master, Kong Yidao has sent someone to ask for help, saying that the soldiers have reached the village."
Story-part18_1_2,These soldiers are utterly shameless. We'll send someone over right away.
Story-part18_name,The Siege of the Small Village

Story-part18_2_3,"Don't panic, Master Kong. {MyFaction}'s disciples are here!"
Story-part18_3_1,"Brothers, you go first. I'll be right behind you..."
Story-part18_3_2,The defense line has been broken. Kong Yidao has been killed. We need to retreat quickly...
Story-part18_4_1,These bastards are even worse than us at the Blue Wind Camp!
Story-part18_4_2,"Master Kong, why do you say that?"
Story-part18_4_3,"Back when I was in charge of the Blue Wind Camp, I thought I was doing righteous deeds and avenging grudges. Turns out, it was all inhuman."
Story-part18_4_4,"Since you can have such insight, why not join our sect, there are plenty of opportunities for you to atone for your sins."
Story-part18_4_5,"I've insulted you many times before, and you're still willing to take me in... Alright, I'll join!"
Story-part18_5_1,"Master, the small village where Kong Yidao is located has been completely leveled by the soldiers' attack."
Story-part18_5_2,"Ah, how could I forget about this..."
Story-part19_1_1,"Master, ever since we occupied the Jiuli Tribe, Miao Muli has been running around and harassing our sect's properties. Please make a decision quickly."
Story-part19_1_2,"Miao Muli has always been committed to reviving the Jiuli Tribe. Now that their ancestral land is occupied by our sect, it's natural for him to be furious and cause trouble."
Story-part19_1_3,"Miao Muli is well-respected in this area. After careful consideration, I believe we should follow the example of Prime Minister Zhuge in the past and focus on appeasement."
Story-part19_name,Pacify Jiuli
Story-part19_log,"Miao Muli often harasses your sect's industry, intending to reclaim the ancestral land, you are preparing to send someone to pacify."
Story-part19_2_1,"You guys, guard this place for the chief of our tribe, remember not to let the Central Plains people mix in."
Story-part19_2_2,"You guys, follow the chief of our tribe to raid {MyFaction}'s stronghold."
Story-part19_2_3,"Miao Muli, don't waste your effort, no matter how many times you harass, you can't shake the influence of our sect."
Story-part19_2_4,"The head of the sect knows that you are dedicated to reviving the Jiuli tribe, and you are not a Wolf who is ambitious for power and private gain, so we are sent to pacify you."
Story-part19_2_5,Our sect will guarantee the living expenses of the Jiuli Tribesman and a separate autonomous region. The only condition is that you and your people must give up attacking and join our sect.
Story-part19_2_6,"What a joke, don't you know the bloody nature of the Jiuli people who swear to death? Since you have come to your door, the chief of our tribe will accept it with a smile!"
Story-part19_3_1,"As expected, they are a bunch of cowards who only know how to run away. The great cause of the chief of our tribe to reclaim the Jiuli base is just around the corner haha!"
Story-part19_4_1,"Give up Miao Muli, if it comes to Inseparable fighting, you will never be the opponent of our sect."
Story-part19_4_2,"Even so, what about it?"
Story-part19_4_3,"The chief of our tribe has been guarding this place for generations. If you kill me, you will definitely lose the hearts of the Jiuli people."
Story-part19_4_4,"Since the Miao chief is dedicated to reviving the Jiuli tribe, he must know a lot about the history of Jiuli's rise and fall, right?"
Story-part19_4_5,"Of course, whether it's historical origins or local customs, the chief of our tribe knows everything!"
Story-part19_4_6,"It is rumored that in ancient times, Jiuli had a chief who was known as the god of the army, who invented and forged various weapons. The Jiuli people used this weapon advantage to rise up and fight against the well-equipped Central Plains tribes in Zhuolu, and finally lost."
Story-part19_4_7,"Huh, Chiyou, the chief of the tribe, is invincible, and in the end he just lost to your cunning Central Plains people."
Story-part19_4_8,"At this time, Jiuli should be the strongest you can imagine, right? If our sect can help you Recovery this past glory?"
Story-part19_4_9,"Now Jiuli has a unique weapon technique that has been passed down from mouth to mouth, but there is no Skillful Artisan and metal raw materials. As long as you are willing to join our sect, we can provide these, how about it?"
Story-part19_4_10,"I didn't expect to bring up the story of Chiyou, the chief of the tribe... Well, I admit that what you just said is very attractive, but there is no proof, I want Ore and craftsmen now!"
Story-part19_4_11,"Craftsmen are naturally no problem, but this ore..."
Story-part19_4_12,"(Miao Muli was somewhat persuaded, should I give out the ore?)"
Story-part19_op_1_1,"Hang on slowly, in case of repentance"
Story-part19_op_1_2,"Trust the chief, give it now (-5000)"
Story-part19_5_1,"Our sect's ore is not much, if you take it and repent, it will hurt."
Story-part19_5_2,"You Central Plains people just like to treat others as fools, let's wait and see!"
Story-part19_5_3,"Damn, Miao Muli suddenly ran into the woods, and there is probably no chance to negotiate again."
Story-part19_6_1,"There is a mine of our sect nearby, which not only has a huge output, but also stores a large amount of ore. If you are willing to join our sect, we can transfer it to Jiuli Tribesman."
Story-part19_6_2,"Okay, the chief of our tribe has made this deal, and I won't take your ore for nothing, just use this Manual to offset it."
Story-part19_6_3,"However, if you find any unfavorable actions against Jiuli in the future, don't blame the Jiuli tribe for being Impulsive and reckless with you!"
Story-part19_7_1,"Leader, I heard that there was an internal strife in the Jiuli tribe, and Miao Muli was betrayed and disappeared."
Story-part19_7_2,"With Miao Muli missing, it's even harder for us to win over the Jiuli tribe..."
Story-part20_1_1,"Leader, a new underground organization called ""Surprised Phoenix"" has recently appeared in Flame City. They not only bully the market, but also eliminate dissidents under various names, and have subtly become the underground ruler of Flame City."
Story-part20_1_2,"The merchants and nobles of Flame City, as well as the underworld, are all very dissatisfied with the ""Surprised Phoenix"" organization, but they have all suffered losses in several confrontations."
Story-part20_1_3,"Strange, if they want to control Flame City secretly, why would they offend various forces in Flame City?"
Story-part20_1_4,"What's even stranger is that our Gatekeeping Disciple received a verbal message from the leader of ""Surprised Phoenix"", inviting you to meet at a certain tavern."
Story-part20_1_5,"Hmph, thinking that a so-called Hongmen banquet can intimidate, it's really laughable."
Story-part20_name,Hongmen Surprised Phoenix
Story-part20_log,"An underground organization called Surprised Phoenix has suddenly risen in Flame City, inviting you to go alone."
Story-part20_2_1,"This is the first time I, as the leader, have come to Flame City. The customs here are indeed very different from those in the Central Plains."
Story-part20_2_2,"Turn this street, and you should be able to see the tavern where I agreed to meet with the leader of ""Surprised Phoenix""."
Story-part20_2_3,"Leader, the other party may have set up an ambush in the tavern. We only have a few people. Should we reconsider?"
Story-part20_2_4,"No problem, they not only underestimated my courage as the leader, but also underestimated my strength as the leader. Just go to the meeting."
Story-part20_2_5,"{PlayerName}, today is your death day!"
Story-part20_2_6,"These bastards actually started halfway, protect the leader!"
Story-part20_3_1,"The timing of these assassins' sneak attacks is too good, and it will be more unfavorable to continue fighting. Retreat to the sect first!"
Story-part20_4_1,"Report to the leader, these assassins have all been killed."
Story-part20_4_2,"These assassins look fierce, but they are weak in fighting. They are just like feeding moves... Why is this?"
Story-part20_4_3,"You cleaned up these Assassins in public\nMany people from Flame City who have been threatened and oppressed by Jing Luan have come forward\nNot only did they care about you, but they also regarded you as the savior of Flame City..."
Story-part20_4_4,"(The tavern is just ahead, what should we do next?)"
Story-part20_op_1_1,"Return to the sect, mobilize Disciples to hunt down the whole city"
Story-part20_op_1_2,"Something is strange, continue to the tavern for the meeting"
Story-part20_5_1,The appointment to see me is just a cover for assassination. There is no need to move forward. Retreat to the sect!
Story-part20_6_1,"If these Assassins really want to assassinate me, they would definitely not fight so fake."
Story-part20_6_2,"Something is strange, according to the original plan, we continue to go to the tavern for the meeting."
Story-part20_6_3,"You walk into the tavern, but find it empty\nOnly a beautiful woman with outstanding demeanor is smiling..."
Story-part20_6_4,"I didn't expect that after the Divine Flame Sect collapsed, the Suzaku envoy could establish such a powerful organization to oppose our sect in a short time. It's really a good method."
Story-part20_6_5,"{PlayerSurName} Leader is joking, if I really want to be an enemy of your sect, why would I order those assassins to deliberately let water?"
Story-part20_6_6,"Maybe it's because I'm afraid that if I really get rid of {PlayerSurName}, I won't be able to resist the subsequent retaliation from my sect."
Story-part20_6_7,"No, no, I have no intention of harming you. The so-called assassination is just a play for others to watch."
Story-part20_6_8,"After the Divine Flame Sect was destroyed, your sect occupied Flame City. But as the saying goes, a centipede dies but never falls, there are too many people here influenced by Fang Sect Master's residual power, and they have no good feelings for your sect."
Story-part20_6_9,"But now it's different, you are the public enemy of Flame City, ""Jing Luan"". All kinds of forces in the city can't wait to ask your sect to take action and remove the ""Jing Luan"" thorn in their eyes."
Story-part20_6_10,Is all this part of your plan?
Story-part20_6_11,"Of course, the whole ""Jing Luan"" is a big gift for {PlayerSurName} Sect Master, it can be said that it was just a discarded piece of mine to join your sect from the beginning."
Story-part20_6_12,"As long as you follow my plan, {MyFaction} will be able to completely control Flame City, and then radiate its influence to the entire Western Regions."
Story-part20_6_13,"My exchange condition is not greedy, I just want an important position in your sect, how about this deal is still profitable~"
Story-part20_6_14,"(Although Feng Xuanji calculated our sect, it is indeed beneficial and harmless to our sect. Should I agree or not?)"
Story-part20_op_2_1,Refuse
Story-part20_op_2_2,Agree
Story-part20_7_1,"You are good at calculating, you are a rare talent, but I, as the sect leader, am not at ease to use such a person."
Story-part20_7_2,"I, as the sect leader, cherish talents and give you a way to survive. You go."
Story-part20_7_3,"If {PlayerSurName} Sect Master dare not use me, it is {MyFaction}'s own loss, goodbye!"
Story-part20_8_1,"I didn't expect you to think so highly of our sect. I, as the sect leader, really like this big gift. I hope you can use this clever calculation on the enemies of our sect in the future."
Story-part20_8_2,I thank the sect leader!
Story-part20_8_3,This Solar Fist Manual was secretly taken by me when the Divine Flame Sect was destroyed. Now it is just right to give it to our sect.
Story-part20_9_1,"Sect leader, the leader of ""Jing Luan"" suddenly disappeared, and the major forces in Flame City took this opportunity to eradicate this public enemy of Flame City."
Story-part20_9_2,"You can't live by doing evil, it also saves our sect trouble."
Story-part21_1_1,"Sect leader, our sect is now growing and developing, and it has the qualifications to dominate the world. But in my opinion, there is still a long-term worry."
Story-part21_1_2,Oh? What is the long-term worry?
Story-part21_1_3,"The long-term worry of our sect is the reserve of talents in the sect, which cannot keep up with the expansion speed of our sect."
Story-part21_1_4,"I have an Intimate friend who is proud and powerful. He was originally the White Tiger Envoy of the Divine Flame Sect, but he had many conflicts with Fang Xiaoian and finally Run away from the sect and lived in seclusion in Bailing Mountain."
Story-part21_1_5,"If the sect leader wants to recruit this person, you can send a Disciple to find him in Bailing Mountain, and don't send more. If he refuses, just show my token."
Story-part21_1_6,"Since such a talent, I will personally contact him."
Story-part21_name,White Tiger Breaks Army
Story-part21_log,"Feng Xuanji recommends her friend to join your sect, you are ready to send someone to contact."
Story-part21_2_1,"From the moment you climbed the snow mountain, I have been watching you."
Story-part21_2_2,I am {MyFaction}...
Story-part21_2_3,I'm not interested in who you are.
Story-part21_2_4,You have such skills but live alone on the snow mountain. You must be very lonely. Why not make a friend.
Story-part21_2_5,I don't need friends.
Story-part21_2_6,"Get out, don't challenge my patience."
Story-part21_2_7,What if I don't want to roll?
Story-part21_2_8,Then let me try how good you are!
Story-part21_3_1,"If you don't roll again, I will kill you."
Story-part21_3_2,"It's too cold here, martial arts can't be used at all, I have to give up."
Story-part21_4_1,You are not bad...
Story-part21_4_2,"You are not bad either, do you consider joining our sect?"
Story-part21_4_3,"Just with you, you are not qualified."
Story-part21_4_4,"What if I say, it's Miss Feng Xuanji who wants you to join our sect?"
Story-part21_4_5,What! You've seen her?
Story-part21_4_6,"Not only have I seen her, but I also have this Golden Thread Phoenix Hairpin as a token. She needs you to help our sect."
Story-part21_4_7,She... she finally agreed to accept my help...
Story-part21_4_8,"Thank you for delivering the message, brother. My martial arts skills are decent enough to be presented on stage. Consider it a thank you gift for your sect taking care of Feng'er."
Story-part21_5_1,The sect leader hasn't sent anyone to contact the former White Tiger Envoy for so long. I guess he doesn't think highly of this person.
Story-part21_5_2,The quality of soldiers matters more than the quantity. There's no rush to recruit talents at the moment.
Story-part22_1_1,I received information from a spy today. A group of unidentified people are planning to besiege Chang'an Inn. I hope the sect leader can send someone to lift the siege.
Story-part22_1_2,"Chang'an Inn is no longer safe. If the sect leader could send someone to bring her back to the sect, I would be very grateful."
Story-part22_1_3,"Leave this minor matter to me, the sect leader."
Story-part22_name,Chang'an Inn
Story-part22_log,"The Chang'an Inn, run by the Feng Xuanji sisters, is besieged by villains. She asks for your help."
Story-part22_2_1,"Haitang Qiu, today Chang'an Inn has been surrounded by us, there will be no more reinforcements, you surrender."
Story-part22_2_2,"My inn has been open for so long, what kind of storm has not experienced, just by these few people also want to scare me!"
Story-part22_2_3,"Your Chang'an Inn has been open for too long, it's time to change hands. Now that the Divine Flame Sect is destroyed, Feng Xuanji is missing, let's see who can protect you this time!"
Story-part22_2_4,I alone will protect it. Do you have a problem with that?
Story-part22_2_5,"Chang'an Inn is already under the control of us {MyFaction}, even if you want to beat a dog, you should see who the owner is, let alone such an outstanding Innkeeper."
Story-part22_2_6,You're full of big words. Don't think I'll be afraid of you just because you mention the name of {MyFaction}.
Story-part22_3_1,"Go back to your milk, haha, Haitang Qiu and this Chang'an Inn are mine!"
Story-part22_3_2,I couldn't save the Innkeeper. I don't know how to explain this to Miss Feng...
Story-part22_4_1,"A bunch of fools who don't know their own limitations, dare to make trouble under the nose of the powerful."
Story-part22_4_2,"Innkeeper, did they hurt you?"
Story-part22_4_3,Their skills can't hurt a single hair on me.
Story-part22_4_4,By the way... how did you know about the trouble in my inn?
Story-part22_4_5,Feng Xuanji knew you were in trouble and repeatedly asked me to come and help. You should thank her.
Story-part22_4_6,"Of course, but since the Divine Flame Sect was destroyed, I haven't heard from her. Where is she now?"
Story-part22_4_7,Miss Feng has joined our sect. She asked me to tell you that Chang'an Inn is no longer safe and hopes you will join {MyFaction} as well.
Story-part22_4_8,"This Chang'an Inn is my family business, how can I just abandon it... Never mind, after all, it was you and her who saved me..."
Story-part22_4_9,"Wait for me to pack up my belongings, then you can take me to the sect to see her."
Story-part22_5_1,"Sect leader, Chang'an Inn has been raided by someone, and even the Innkeeper Haitang Qiu has disappeared."
Story-part22_5_2,"Damn, I forgot about Miss Feng's commission. I've let her down..."
Story-part23_1_1,"Sect leader, there's someone you'd never expect who has come to our sect and wants to see you."
Story-part23_1_2,"I, the sect leader, have seen all kinds of people. Who could possibly surprise me?"
Story-part23_1_3,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader, it's me..."
Story-part23_1_4,"Tsukuyo Sakuraha? You, the remnant of Great Ant City, dare to come to our sect?"
Story-part23_1_5,"You people from Great Ant City first occupied Lin'an for your own interests, causing countless people to be displaced."
Story-part23_1_6,"Then you crazily expanded to get a piece of the Central Plains, causing heavy casualties among the martial arts community."
Story-part23_1_7,"Believe it or not, if I spread the news of your presence here, there will be countless people rushing to bring you to justice."
Story-part23_1_8,"{PlayerSurName}Sect Leader, it's because of my trust in you... that I have to find you."
Story-part23_1_9,"Actually, when the Great Ant City was destroyed, it wasn't just me who escaped, but also the real mastermind behind the invasion of Great Ant City, Hisahide Saito. My father didn't want to do such a devastating thing, but he was forced to do so by Saito, who threatened me."
Story-part23_1_10,"The one who was captured was just Saito's Shadow Warrior. He himself has taken advantage of the laxity of the Central Plains martial arts world, and is preparing to retreat to Dongying with the Imperial Seal, attempting to make a comeback."
Story-part23_1_11,Why are you telling me all this?
Story-part23_1_12,"Because I don't want to make the same mistake again. If Saito gets what he wants, then Dongying and Zhao will become mortal enemies, fighting endlessly!"
Story-part23_1_13,"{PlayerSurName}Sect Leader, you are the martial arts hero I admire the most, please help me atone for this sin..."
Story-part23_1_14,"Although there are many things I don't understand, I will help you with this. I hope you can explain it to me later. Time is of the essence, let's go!"
Story-part23_name,Imperial Seal
Story-part23_log,You have learned that Hisahide Saito is trying to return to Dongying with the Imperial Seal.
Story-part23_2_1,"These Zhao people are really stupid. I have the Imperial Seal in my hand, and they are still celebrating their victory."
Story-part23_2_2,"As long as I can safely return to Dongying, I can use the Imperial Seal as a pledge to exchange for a large number of loyal and brave Dongying soldiers from the General. By then, with the joint attack of the Yan army, at least half of Zhao's land will be mine, haha!"
Story-part23_2_3,"Saito, return the jade seal, or you will never be able to laugh after today!"
Story-part23_2_4,"Hey, I was wondering who it was, turns out it's you, the fallen princess. What, Tsukuyo, you also have your eyes on this Imperial Seal?"
Story-part23_2_5,"You, for your own selfish desires, forced my father while holding me hostage, and now you want to stir up trouble again. I, Tsukuyo Sakuraha, will do everything I can to stop you."
Story-part23_2_6,Just you? My young lady? Hahaha!
Story-part23_2_7,"And me, isn't that enough?"
Story-part23_2_8,"{PlayerName}! How did you...\nDamn it, since I'm going to die anyway, let the number one person in the Central Plains martial arts world witness my ultimate battle technique - the Shadow Warrior Art!"
Story-part23_3_1,"What number one person in the Central Plains martial arts world, it's all hearsay, die!"
Story-part23_3_2,"{PlayerName}Sect Leader, you go quickly! Although I can't stop him, I have a way to die with him!"
Story-part23_3_3,"Go quickly, if you don't go now, you won't have a chance!"
Story-part23_3_4,"I underestimated Saito, go quickly, otherwise it would be a waste of Miss Tsukuyo's efforts..."
Story-part23_4_1,Impossible...
Story-part23_4_2,"In the face of absolute power, your little tricks are not worth mentioning!"
Story-part23_4_3,"{PlayerName} Sect Leader, thank you for helping me to reduce a bit of my sins..."
Story-part23_4_4,"Although it sounds like an excuse now, I've long wanted to run away from the Great Ant City, to get away from these things that I don't care about or like."
Story-part23_4_5,"But I was too cowardly, too cowardly to say no to my father, to Saito, and even more cowardly to act, to fight against those ugly and cruel things."
Story-part23_4_6,"If I had been more determined from the start, none of this would have happened... I'm a sinner who deserves to die."
Story-part23_4_7,I think you've been very brave.
Story-part23_4_8,What?
Story-part23_4_9,"At least, you told me about Saito's escape, and you did your best to stop him."
Story-part23_4_10,"If you were once a criminal who committed the crime of being an accomplice, now, you have become a brave person who can face your own mistakes."
Story-part23_4_11,"You should have nowhere to go now, how about joining {MyFaction}? In that way, you will have more opportunities to atone for your sins, no, to help those who were hurt because of your Great Ant City."
Story-part23_4_12,"{PlayerName} leader, I will remember every word you say now... then... please guide me more!"
Story-part23_5_1,"{PlayerName} leader, it seems that you still don't believe in me..."
Story-part23_5_2,"I will use my life to stop Saito, to make you believe all this!"
Story-part24_1_1,"Leader, now that Yan Yun Iron Army has been defeated, Vagabond is hunting down the remnants of the Yan Army everywhere, and there is a sense of self-preservation."
Story-part24_1_2,Remnants? What remnants?
Story-part24_1_3,"After the Yan Yun Iron Army was destroyed, those enemy leaders who were not killed or injured were all imprisoned in the main city, where are the remnants?"
Story-part24_1_4,"I heard that they surrounded Baoguo Temple a few days ago, saying that a girl who is about to become a nun is the Lady of Yan Kingdom, and they must force the Abbot to hand her over for public execution."
Story-part24_1_5,Lady of Yan Kingdom... Did the Abbot hand her over?
Story-part24_1_6,"The Abbot only said that Buddha saves those who are destined, and since this girl has a heart of atonement, she should not use weapons again, and all the hatred towards the Yan Army should be concentrated on one person."
Story-part24_1_7,"Those Vagabonds are relentless, thinking that the Abbot is harboring evil intentions and colluding with foreign races, clamoring to attack Baoguo Temple."
Story-part24_1_8,"There is such a thing, should I go over and see what's going on?"
Story-part24_name,The Siege of Baoguo
Story-part24_log,"Lady of Yan Kingdom wants to become a nun in Baoguo Temple to atone for her sins, but she is besieged by Vagabonds."
Story-part24_2_1,"Amitabha, Princess Wanyan just wants to repent for her past sins and chant sutras for those who have passed away because of her. Neither Buddha nor I can refuse anyone's heart of kindness."
Story-part24_2_2,"Abbot, you are well-versed in the great righteousness of Buddhism, why do you want to protect such extremely evil people? I am willing to be a peacemaker, and I hope that the Abbot will give priority to the overall situation and hand over Wanyan Zhaoning to calm the public anger."
Story-part24_2_3,"If the Abbot continues to protect this foreign enemy leader, don't blame the heroes present for thinking that Baoguo Temple is related to the Yan Army."
Story-part24_2_4,"If you don't hand over the person, I will tear down this broken temple and let you bald donkeys go to see Buddha!"
Story-part24_2_5,"Everyone must not be soft-hearted, if this Wanyan evil woman is not killed here, my Zhao country will not be able to eliminate the disaster and return to peace and tranquility!"
Story-part24_2_6,Eliminate the disaster...
Story-part24_2_7,"When I was willing to serve my uncle Wanyan Wuzhu, I also had the same initial intention for the peace of the world."
Story-part24_2_8,My uncle told me that the Zhao Kingdom is corrupt and the people are living in misery. Only by achieving true unification of the two countries can we eliminate all the troubles of war and return peace to the world.
Story-part24_2_9,And those bleedings and sacrifices are just the price that must be paid...
Story-part24_2_10,"I believed in what my uncle said at that time, but now it seems that this path is not feasible, so I became a monk out of despair. But since you want to eradicate evil, let me be the sacrifice."
Story-part24_2_11,"(Wanyan Zhaoning actively seeks death, should I stop it?)"
Story-part24_op_1_1,"She is deeply sinful, it's better to die"
Story-part24_op_1_2,"She has a great realization, the crime is not deadly"
Story-part24_3_1,"She is deeply sinful, it's better to die, I will just watch quietly."
Story-part24_3_2,"No need for you to act, I will take care of it myself."
Story-part24_3_3,"Abbot, it's my fault that Baoguo Temple is involved. If there is a next life, I wish to be a stick of incense in front of the Buddha, burning day and night, praying for the people..."
Story-part24_3_4,"Tsk, dying so easily, she got off too lightly."
Story-part24_3_5,Amitabha...
Story-part24_3_6,"Wanyan Zhaoning has taken her own life, there's no need to stay any longer."
Story-part24_4_1,"She has already seen the truth, her sins are not deadly, I have to stop it."
Story-part24_4_2,"No need for you to act, I will take care of it myself."
Story-part24_4_3,"Stop, Princess Wanyan is not guilty of death!"
Story-part24_4_4,……
Story-part24_4_5,"Amitabha, if {PlayerSurName} is here, Princess Wanyan can be saved."
Story-part24_4_6,"Although Princess Wanyan has become a pawn for the tiger, she was also misled and used by Wanyan Wuzhu, unknowingly going astray."
Story-part24_4_7,"This time the Yan army invaded, Wanyan Wuzhu was certainly the mastermind, but those corrupt officials in the Zhao Kingdom's court, and those who bring disaster to the country and the people, shouldn't they be more responsible than Princess Wanyan?"
Story-part24_4_8,"{PlayerSurName}, as the head of the sect, you are highly respected and skilled in martial arts, but for such a major issue, please do not interfere."
Story-part24_4_9,"Can't you see it? {MyFaction} has long been in cahoots with the Yan dogs, it's a shame he still has the face to come here and pretend."
Story-part24_4_10,"Pretend? When I, the head of the sect, was fighting bloody battles with the Yan army, where were you? Don't try to provoke me, or else..."
Story-part24_4_11,"Don't be afraid, even if his martial arts are high, if we unite and rush up, he won't be able to defeat all of us!"
Story-part24_4_12,Oh? Then let's give it a try~
Story-part24_5_1,"It seems I've overdone it... These people are all skilled in martial arts, I'd better escape back to the sect..."
Story-part24_5_2,Although... thank you...
Story-part24_6_1,"I have protected Princess Wanyan, does anyone else have any objections?"
Story-part24_6_2,"Abbot, your temple is small and can't protect Princess Wanyan, how about I take her to {MyFaction}? If her repentance is not firm, I will teach her on behalf of the Buddha, how about that?"
Story-part24_6_3,"Princess Wanyan, are you willing to go with {PlayerSurName}?"
Story-part24_6_4,"Master, don't call me princess anymore, I have nothing to do with Yan country now, I am just an ordinary person. Since {PlayerSurName} is willing to save me, a lowly woman, why wouldn't I go..."
Story-part24_6_5,"Amitabha, in that case, I'll have to trouble you."
Story-part24_6_6,"{PlayerSurName}, thank you..."
Story-part24_7_1,"Master, the Vagabonds have broken into Baoguo Temple and kidnapped Princess Wanyan."
Story-part24_7_2,"This is the bitter fruit she has brewed by being a pawn for the tiger, she can't blame others."
Story-part25_1_1,"Master, villagers have reported that a strange wooden house has suddenly appeared in Wuxian Mountain recently."
Story-part25_1_2,"Just a wooden house, what's so strange about that?"
Story-part25_1_3,"There's nothing special about the wooden house itself, but the animals dare not approach within two feet of the house, even screaming and fleeing desperately, as if there's something terrifying there..."
Story-part25_1_4,"Such a strange thing, I, the head of the sect, will go and see for myself."
Story-part25_name,Mysterious Wooden House
Story-part25_log,"A strange little house has appeared in Wuxian Mountain recently, no animal dares to approach it."
Story-part25_2_1,"Hero, that's the house ahead, you can't go any further!"
Story-part25_2_2,"Old Man's twelve-year-old grandson came here chasing a group of butterflies yesterday. Out of curiosity, he took a few steps towards the hut and suddenly fainted."
Story-part25_2_3,"Fortunately, a passerby saw him and immediately hooked him out with a grappling hook, but my poor grandson is still foaming at the mouth and talking nonsense, lying half-dead on the bed!"
Story-part25_2_4,"The neighbors say that you {MyFaction} are all virtuous heroes, please save Old Man's grandson!"
Story-part25_2_5,Does it sound like symptoms of some kind of poisoning?
Story-part25_2_6,"Animals have the most sensitive sense of smell, so they dare not approach the hut, which has caused the naughty child to suffer."
Story-part25_2_7,Who could be so cruel to deliberately poison a quarantine zone to prevent outsiders from entering the hut...
Story-part25_2_8,Should I force my way in to find out?
Story-part25_op_1_1,"Toxicology is tricky, it's better to retreat first"
Story-part25_op_1_2,"To save the child, I have to take a risk"
Story-part25_3_1,"Toxicology is tricky, it's troublesome if you get poisoned, it's better to retreat first and find someone who understands toxicology..."
Story-part25_3_2,"After you return to your sect, you immediately send the disciple who is best at toxicology there\nBut found that not only was it deserted, but there was blood everywhere\nIt seems that a fierce fight took place after you left..."
Story-part25_4_1,"There's no choice, life is at stake, I have to take a risk to save this child!"
Story-part25_4_2,"You silently run your protection internal strength and slowly walk towards the wooden house\nAt first, you didn't feel any discomfort\nBut as you take more and more steps, a sweet taste gradually rises in your throat..."
Story-part25_4_3,"If it's to save that so-called grandson, I suggest you turn back immediately."
Story-part25_4_4,"You are highly skilled, and the current poison is only in your flesh. If you go out and expel it yourself, it won't hurt. But if you insist on approaching despite my advice, don't blame me for not warning you when you get deep poison!"
Story-part25_4_5,"The person in the house and Old Man's statements conflict, should I continue to move forward?"
Story-part25_4_6,"You have deep martial arts skills, the current poison only affects your skin and flesh. With your own cultivation, you can expel it with a little effort, and you will be safe."
Story-part25_4_7,"But if you insist on approaching despite my advice, don't blame me for not warning you when you get deeply poisoned!"
Story-part25_op_2_1,Go out and detoxify
Story-part25_op_2_2,Continue to move forward
Story-part25_5_1,"After a full meal, listen to the advice, go out and detoxify first, I can't control the situation here alone."
Story-part25_5_2,"After you return to your sect, you immediately send the disciple who is best at toxicology there\nBut found that not only was it deserted, but there was blood everywhere\nIt seems that a fierce fight took place after you left..."
Story-part25_6_1,"In order to save people, how can I care about my own life, I must continue to move forward!"
Story-part25_6_2,"Cough cough cough... My consciousness is gradually blurring, there are two more steps..."
Story-part25_6_3,"Forget it... Although you were deceived by a treacherous person, you are also a passionate and righteous person."
Story-part25_6_4,"I have already removed the poison, you quickly take this medicine and take a deep breath."
Story-part25_6_5,"Thank you, miss..."
Story-part25_6_6,"Good grandson, have you almost expelled your poison? The hero of {MyFaction} tested the poison with his own body, breaking through Jiang Ziyan's poisonous miasma for us, now is the best time to grab that thing."
Story-part25_6_7,Listen to the clan uncle's instructions!
Story-part25_6_8,"Old man, you dare to deceive the head of my sect, I will make you pay!"
Story-part25_7_1,"I still have some secret self-defense techniques, you are poisoned and staying here is also a hindrance, go quickly!"
Story-part25_7_2,"Miss Jiang has led the enemy away, quickly retreat back to the sect..."
Story-part25_8_1,"Old Man didn't know that {PlayerSurName} head was here, please spare my life!"
Story-part25_8_2,So you are the head of {PlayerSurName}...
Story-part25_8_3,"I carry a treasure and will be hunted wherever I go. The head of {PlayerSurName} seems to be a reliable and righteous person, I wonder if you can take me in?"
Story-part25_8_4,"Of course, as long as Miss Jiang trusts {PlayerSurName}, no one will dare to trouble you in the future."
Story-part25_9_1,"Leader, the cottage on Wuxian Mountain was suddenly empty last night, and the investigating Disciple didn't find anything special."
Story-part25_9_2,"It's just a rumor, don't bother me with such things in the future."
Story-part26_1_1,"Leader, a strange old man suddenly came to our sect asking for medicine."
Story-part26_1_2,"Huh? Even if the Herbology Sect is gone, it shouldn't be asking for medicine from our sect, could it be..."
Story-part26_1_3,Could it be... who told others that I bought the Full recovery pill at a high price!
Story-part26_name,Old man asking for medicine
Story-part26_log,"A strange old man came to ask for medicine, it seems he heard that you have a Full recovery pill."
Story-part26_2_1,Life is just a grand dream~
Story-part26_2_2,Only I can see through it~
Story-part26_2_3,"Kid, I've been waiting for you~"
Story-part26_2_4,"Old Man, you came to ask me for medicine, why are you reciting poems and playing the old card..."
Story-part26_2_5,You don't even want to call me...
Story-part26_2_6,{PlayerSurName} Leader!
Story-part26_2_7,"Kid, you are just a small sect leader, just showing off in this small area."
Story-part26_2_8,"But my skill, Yan Gexing, was second to none in the past!"
Story-part26_2_9,"It's just because I was framed by a treacherous person, that's why I lost my cultivation and came to you for medicine."
Story-part26_op_1_1,"It's just a pill, here you go."
Story-part26_op_1_2,"Medicine, what medicine, do we have such a thing?"
Story-part26_3_1,"It's just a pill, here you go."
Story-part26_3_2,Is it this Full recovery pill?
Story-part26_3_3,"Yes, yes, yes, I heard that this medicine can restore Meridian, can you give it to me?"
Story-part26_3_4,"Who made me feel inexplicably kind to you, take it quickly, don't get hurt next time."
Story-part26_3_5,"I won't say anything else, when I recover my skills, I will help you become a Jianghu Master!"
Story-part26_3_6,"Yan Gexing took the pill with tears in his eyes and swallowed it in one gulp. Then he sat down on the spot, holding his breath and concentrating. After three shichen, he suddenly opened his eyes."
Story-part26_3_7,"It's really a rare divine medicine, it made me..."
Story-part26_3_8,"How is it, have you successfully recovered your skills?"
Story-part26_3_9,It made me have a good sleep...
Story-part26_3_10,"Well, I actually expected this situation, I was just desperate for a cure."
Story-part26_3_11,"Kid, I see that you not only have amazing bones and extraordinary talent, but also a kind heart. I'll give you a good opportunity to take me in."
Story-part26_3_12,"Jianghu is dangerous, every day countless small sects disappear, let me be the advisor of your sect, to guide you."
Story-part26_4_1,"Medicine, what medicine, do we have such a thing?"
Story-part26_4_2,"Don't play dumb, I've been staring at that Full recovery pill for a long time, but I couldn't afford it. I didn't expect you to get it."
Story-part26_4_3,"I remind you, stop calling me kid, or I'll eat that Full recovery pill right now!"
Story-part26_4_4,"Stop, don't swallow the medicine!!!"
Story-part26_5_1,"You're so vigorous and lively, how can you say you've lost your cultivation!"
Story-part26_5_2,"Anyway, after you scared me, I swallowed the medicine, and you have nothing to eat."
Story-part26_5_3,"Well, it's not meant to be... I'll leave..."
Story-part26_5_4,Yan Gexing sighed and turned to leave silently...
Story-part26_6_1,"You're not planning to scam me, are you? I didn't initiate the fight."
Story-part26_6_2,"Anyway, after you scared me, I swallowed the medicine, and you have nothing to eat."
Story-part26_6_3,"Indeed, my cultivation is completely depleted, and now I can't even beat a minor sect leader."
Story-part26_6_4,"Well, it's not meant to be... I'll leave..."
Story-part26_6_5,Wait a minute?
Story-part26_6_6,"Kid, what else do you want?"
Story-part26_6_7,"Although your Meridian is broken, from those two moves just now, I can still see some skill. I, the sect leader, have a fate with you. Seeing your extraordinary bones and exceptional talent, would you consider joining my sect~"
Story-part26_6_8,Huh?
Story-part26_6_9,"My first reaction was quite outrageous, but upon further thought, it's not impossible..."
Story-part26_6_10,"How about this, I can be an advisor to your sect, responsible for guiding the younger generation. But in exchange, you have to find a way to heal my injuries, okay?"
Story-part26_6_11,Then welcome to join us~
Story-part26_7_1,"I've been busy recently and forgot about the old man who came to our sect for medicine, how is he now?"
Story-part26_7_2,"Reporting to the sect leader, the old man refused to leave and kept claiming that he was the founder of a major sect in the Peak of Jianghu, so he was carried away by the disciples."
Story-part26_7_3,"Forget it, let's not worry about him, I still have a lot of things to do."
Story-part27_1_1,"Kid, I heard..."
Story-part27_1_2,"Yan elder, although you are an advisor to our sect, please address me as ""sect leader"" in your address, thank you."
Story-part27_1_3,"Humph, I'll call you that."
Story-part27_1_4,"Sect leader kid, I heard that our sect has recently expanded its influence to the territory of Melody House."
Story-part27_1_5,"There is a forbidden place in Melody House called the Immortal Spring. My sect's heart method combined with the water of the Immortal Spring can completely eliminate the hidden dangers of old injuries, so..."
Story-part27_1_6,"Oh, I see, after I finish my current work, let's go to the Immortal Spring together."
Story-part27_name,Immortal Spring
Story-part27_log,"Yan Gexing said that the Immortal Spring can eliminate his old injuries, and he asked you to accompany him there."
Story-part27_2_1,This must be the legendary Eternal Spring...
Story-part27_2_2,"Head of the sect, go and keep watch for me. I need to heal my injuries through meditation."
Story-part27_2_3,"Alright, alright, your healing is important, Old Man..."
Story-part27_2_4,The highest goodness is like water...
Story-part27_2_5,"Water benefits all things without contention. It stays in places that people dislike. Therefore, it is similar to the Tao..."
Story-part27_2_6,"Yan Gexing sat in the spring eye, slowly using his unique martial arts\nAfter a full six shichen, he finally shouted and jumped up from the water\nThe splashing water woke you up from your deep sleep..."
Story-part27_2_7,Ah... What happened?
Story-part27_2_8,"I didn't expect that in my lifetime, I would have the opportunity to return to the peak of Passive, haha!"
Story-part27_2_9,What was that move just now? It looked pretty cool.
Story-part27_2_10,"Young Sect Leader, come and fight with me, so you won't say I'm bragging!"
Story-part27_2_11,"Well, I, the Sect Leader, will accompany you to practice."
Story-part27_3_1,What kind of strange martial art is this? It actually defeated me in one move!
Story-part27_3_2,"Hehe, now you know how powerful I am! Be humble and learn next time, maybe I will give you some pointers, hm~"
Story-part27_4_1,"Although this battle has given me a lot of insights into Martial Arts, to be honest, compared with me, the Sect Leader, Yan's level is still a bit lacking~"
Story-part27_4_2,"The fist fears the young, you know. When you get old, you won't say that, hmph!"
Story-part27_5_1,"Head of the sect, are you always afraid that after I recover my strength, I will take your position as the head of the sect?"
Story-part27_5_2,"Yan, are you joking? I, as the head of the sect, am not that narrow-minded. I'm just busy with affairs..."
Story-part27_5_3,"Forget it, forget it. At my age, why should I fight for the Peak of Jianghu... sigh..."
Story-part28_1_1,"Head of the sect, a messenger from the Ye Family Battalion has delivered an urgent letter. Please read it as soon as possible."
Story-part28_1_2,"It turns out that a Beiwei Army squad encountered an accident while carrying out a mission near our sect. The details are unclear, and they hope our sect can help confirm the situation."
Story-part28_1_3,We must act quickly and send someone to check it out.
Story-part28_name,Siege of Beiwei
Story-part28_log,"A Beiwei Army squad has mysteriously disappeared near your sect, suspected to have been ambushed."
Story-part28_2_1,The place where the Beiwei Army squad disappeared should be right ahead. Let's investigate carefully and not miss any clues.
Story-part28_2_2,"Judging by the traces here, this Beiwei Army squad seems to have engaged in a battle and, being outnumbered, headed south."
Story-part28_2_3,How dare these audacious villains attack the Ye Family Battalion within Zhao's territory? Let's catch up with them.
Story-part28_2_4,"Great Ant City is handling affairs, unrelated people should retreat for now!"
Story-part28_2_5,"There are a large number of Pifeng City Ninjas fighting with the Beiwei Army ahead, it seems they are the culprits!"
Story-part28_2_6,"You few are no match for our large team, you're courting death!"
Story-part28_3_1,"These Great Ant City scoundrels are numerous, we should retreat back to the sect and plan our next move."
Story-part28_4_1,"No matter how many they are, they can't change the fact that they're trying to shake a tree with a dragonfly."
Story-part28_4_2,"Let's check on the condition of the Beiwei Army brothers. If it weren't for their distraction, we might not have won so easily."
Story-part28_4_3,"Thank you, if it weren't for {MyFaction}, I'm afraid I would have been ambushed by these villains here."
Story-part28_4_4,Marshal Ye! What are you doing here?
Story-part28_4_5,"I heard that there might be a large number of Pifeng City Ninjas infiltrating this area with ill intentions, so I brought a few Beiwei Army soldiers to investigate."
Story-part28_4_6,"I didn't expect the news to leak out, and these Ninjas came out in full force, vowing to assassinate me here. I was outnumbered and forced to retreat while fighting, luckily I managed to hold out until your sect's experts came to the rescue."
Story-part28_4_7,"Thinking of the absurdity of attacking your sect based on false accusations before, I, the general, am deeply grieved..."
Story-part28_4_8,"Marshal Ye, as the saying goes, the son of a rich lady can't sit in the hall. Why do you need to personally handle such a trivial matter as investigating information?"
Story-part28_4_9,"That's not right. If I don't lead by example, then every soldier in the army will take pride in their high position and power, aspiring to be those who enjoy their position without doing anything."
Story-part28_4_10,"In the Ye Family Battalion, although there is a hierarchy, we are all brothers in arms and treat each other equally. Everyone takes guarding the homeland as their ideal, where is the distinction between high and low, noble and humble?"
Story-part28_4_11,"I rashly attacked your sect before, but you saved me in spite of past grievances. Please accept this manual as an apology."
Story-part28_5_1,"Master, I heard that Marshal Ye was in the Beiwei Army squad that asked for help. Because they didn't get support from our sect, not only were the soldiers heavily casualties, but Marshal Ye was also heavily injured..."
Story-part28_5_2,"Fortunately, Marshal Ye is blessed, otherwise I would really be a sinner of the country..."
Story-part29_1_1,"Master, after the Ye Family Battalion was destroyed, my father was disheartened and chose a secluded place to live in seclusion."
Story-part29_1_2,"Now that Great Ant City and Yan Yun Iron Army are watching closely, I want to ask you to accompany me to call my father out of retirement."
Story-part29_1_3,"If you can persuade Marshal Ye to come out of retirement, that would be a great thing!"
Story-part29_name,Cold Cicada's Startled Dream
Story-part29_log,"Ye Yinping found you and wants to ask Ye Pengju, who has retired, to come out of the mountain together."
Story-part29_2_1,This is where my father lives in seclusion. I've been here twice and I'm sure it's the right place.
Story-part29_2_2,Let's go knock on the door now. I don't believe I can't persuade my father!
Story-part29_2_3,深更半夜这么闯进去不太好吧……等等，叶元帅出来了！
Story-part29_2_4,短短数月不见，叶元帅为何变得如此消瘦，想来定是日夜忧国忧民所致……
Story-part29_2_5,昨夜寒蛩不住鸣，惊回千里梦，已三更……
Story-part29_2_6,起来独自绕阶行，人悄悄，帘外月胧明……
Story-part29_2_7,Bai Shou为功名，旧山松竹老，阻规程……
Story-part29_2_8,欲将心事Fu Yaoqin，知音少，弦断有谁听……
Story-part29_2_9,这是一首好词！叶元帅虽然避世归隐，但所思所梦皆是壮志难酬的苦涩心事。
Story-part29_2_10,爹爹，你大半夜不好好睡觉，做什么诗词Coin章呢！
Story-part29_2_11,瓶儿？还有{PlayerSurName}掌门？叶某一时失眠，做了这首《小重山》，让你们见笑了。
Story-part29_2_12,爹爹，别在这里做什么酸诗了！Ye Family Battalion虽然不在了，但还有别的去处让你Guardian of the Homeland呢，和Me一起加入{MyFaction}吧！
Story-part29_2_13,唉，叶某已经心灰意冷，无意再涉足无能为力之事了。
Story-part29_2_14,叶元帅此言差矣，你刚才所做的这首词上阙诉说壮志难伸，下阕表达知音难觅，{PlayerSurName}某可听不出一点心灰意冷之感。
Story-part29_2_15,本派虽然是江湖门派，但一向以家国大事于己任，在下斗胆，恳请叶元帅出山相助！
Story-part29_2_16,就是就是！爹爹你就不要麻痹自己、欺骗别人了。况且Me也加入了{MyFaction}，你就忍心看着Me被别人欺负么哼！
Story-part29_2_17,都说是近朱者赤近墨者黑，瓶儿你和{PlayerSurName}掌门Known后，变得成熟多了，真让为父颇感欣慰。
Story-part29_2_18,看在你们二人的份上，叶某就重新出山一次吧……
Story-part29_3_1,掌门，都怪你一直不肯和Me一起去见爹爹，现在无论Me怎么说，他都死活不肯再出山了……
Story-part29_3_2,叶元帅戎Horse一生，能够全身而退隐居度日也是个好结局，Me们还是不要再去打扰他了。
Story-part30_1_1,掌门，最近有一伙自称新Nine Factions Sect的人，在Lin'an City内招兵买Horse，什么贩夫走卒，什么Mountain Bandit大盗，通通Never Said No。
Story-part30_1_2,门中有Disciple打听到，他们会在三月之内谋划一件大事，还请您First strike早做决断！
Story-part30_1_3,这种事情还是从内部攻破为妙，派几个Disciple过去卧底一下吧。
Story-part30_name,九流再起
Story-part30_log,一伙自称新Nine Factions Sect的人到处招兵买Horse，疑似在谋划一件大事。
Story-part30_2_1,这里应该就是新Nine Factions Sect的纳贤Great hall了，简直乌烟瘴气。
Story-part30_2_2,从行事风格上来说，和之前的Nine Factions Sect并无二致。不管怎么鱼龙混杂，只要愿意加入就Never Said No，这样的门派又有什么凝聚力可言。
Story-part30_2_3,注意点，好像有高层出来了。
Story-part30_2_4,各位父老乡亲，各位好汉当家，Me就是新Nine Factions Sect Master——Tie Mianren！
Story-part30_2_5,诸位既然有意愿投奔Me新Nine Factions Sect，想来都是无处可去的可怜之人。
Story-part30_2_6,"Among you, some have been oppressed by corrupt officials, leading to the loss of your families and homes..."
Story-part30_2_7,"Among you, some have been framed by powerful enemies, losing your social status and becoming outlaws..."
Story-part30_2_8,"Among you, some have worked tirelessly like beasts of burden, living a life worse than the dogs in your masters' homes..."
Story-part30_2_9,"Today, MeTie Mianren is here to tell you that you have the skills to reclaim what you've lost, and to trample those who have humiliated you in the past."
Story-part30_2_10,"No matter what your previous status was, from now on, you are all part of my new Nine Factions Sect."
Story-part30_2_11,"I, the Sect Leader, will teach you advanced Martial Arts that you can quickly master. Once you have mastered them, we will rise up and take over Lin'an City from the inside!"
Story-part30_2_12,Hahahaha!
Story-part30_2_13,Is there anything funny about what I said?
Story-part30_2_14,"I laugh at you for not learning your lesson. The old Nine Factions Sect was destroyed, and now there's a new one just like it. I laugh at your overconfidence, thinking you can overthrow the city we control with these rotten potatoes and bad eggs."
Story-part30_2_15,"So it's the madman from {MyFaction}. Good, let me show you the power of my martial arts!"
Story-part30_3_1,"Tie Mianren's martial arts are too strong, we can't resist even if we join forces. Retreat quickly!"
Story-part30_4_1,How...how is this possible...
Story-part30_4_2,Don't think about causing trouble with these petty tricks. I want to see what kind of face is hidden under your iron mask!
Story-part30_4_3,Qin Huizhi! It's you?
Story-part30_4_4,"How the tables have turned. I never thought I, Qin Huizhi, would be defeated by the likes of you..."
Story-part30_4_5,"Forget it, forget it. I've always had high ambitions, but I've been defeated by you time and again. If you spare me, I'm willing to join your sect and be at your disposal."
Story-part30_4_6,"This Qin Huizhi had harbored ill intentions when he was recruited into our sect. If we let him join the sect, I'm afraid there will be trouble!"
Story-part30_4_7,What should we do with Qin Huizhi?
Story-part30_op_1_1,"Kill him on the spot, leave no trouble for the future"
Story-part30_op_1_2,"Trust in talent, have no doubts in employing people"
Story-part30_5_1,"Such a wolf-hearted and ambitious person should be killed on the spot, leaving no trouble for the future!"
Story-part30_5_2,I will never forgive you even in death...ah...
Story-part30_5_3,Qin Huizhi is dead. A manual was found on his body. Take it back to the sect.
Story-part30_6_1,"Although he is wolf-hearted and ambitious, our sect can control him. Trust in talent."
Story-part30_6_2,"Qin Huizhi, you are now a member of {MyFaction}. If you betray the sect in the future, we will make you regret it!"
Story-part30_6_3,"Don't worry, I won't let your sect down."
Story-part30_7_1,"Master, the new Nine Factions Sect has gathered a large group of gang members and launched a sudden attack on Lin'an City. Fortunately, our disciples and righteous people from the rivers and lakes repelled them."
Story-part30_7_2,"They are just a group of rabble, don't bother with them."
Story-part31_1_1,"The weather is so nice today, it's a good day for me to go out and relax~"
Story-part31_1_2,"After finishing the sect affairs, go out and enjoy the sunshine. Don't waste this beautiful spring day."
Story-part31_name,A day in life
Story-part31_log,"The weather is so nice today, you plan to take a break and enjoy a day in life."
Story-part31_2_1,"You take advantage of the rare leisure time to wander around the city.\nFirst, you eat a bowl of wonton that you've been wanting to eat for a long time.\nThen, you spend a long time petting a cat that you've been wanting to pet for a long time.\nFinally, you arrive at a bustling temple fair.\nYou prepare to fully enjoy the joy of ordinary life away from the martial world..."
Story-part31_2_2,"The craftsmanship of this noodle vendor is really good. I'll buy a few to take back to the sect later, they will surely be delighted~"
Story-part31_2_3,"Hey, what are you looking at so intently that you've stopped kneading the dough figurine in your hand?"
Story-part31_2_4,"Ah... I'm sorry, sir, I just saw Maiden House's Dojokeeper also came to the temple fair, I couldn't help but take a few more glances..."
Story-part31_2_5,Hello... Hello Dojokeeper! This is a candied hawthorn I... I brought for you!
Story-part31_2_6,"This young man is really interesting, here, take the money, I can't just take your candied hawthorn for free~"
Story-part31_2_7,"Maiden House's Dojokeeper? Sigh-- Miss Yan's face is like the autumn moon, her glances are full of affection, she is indeed a rare beauty, no wonder you were staring."
Story-part31_2_8,"Strange, three Vagabonds have emerged from the crowd and blocked Dojokeeper."
Story-part31_2_9,"Gentlemen, why have you suddenly stopped me? What can I do for you?"
Story-part31_2_10,"Miss, your clothes are dirty, let me help you clean it."
Story-part31_2_11,"Where did this pretty girl come from? Looking at her makes me feel hot, hehe~"
Story-part31_2_12,"You two, don't be so abrupt with the lady. If I may, would the lady be willing to accompany us for a while? We three brothers guarantee to satisfy you~"
Story-part31_2_13,...What if I say no?
Story-part31_2_14,"Since the lady is not giving us, the three heroes of Wind and Cloud, face, then I will have to insist!"
Story-part31_2_15,"Didn't expect to encounter such a trivial matter, should I step in to save the beauty?"
Story-part31_op_1_1,Better to mind my own business
Story-part31_op_1_2,Let go of that girl!
Story-part31_3_1,"Better to mind my own business, just take the dough figurines and go back to the sect."
Story-part31_4_1,"As the sect leader, I will only say it once, let go of that girl!"
Story-part31_4_2,"Where did this wild boy come from, daring to meddle in our business, brothers, teach him a lesson!"
Story-part31_5_1,"What kind of sect leader, trying to act tough without the ability!"
Story-part31_5_2,"I was careless, I should go back to the sect to heal..."
Story-part31_6_1,"Sect leader, you are merciful, don't hit me anymore..."
Story-part31_6_2,"Today, I will give you a name, let's call you the Three Dizzy Bears, haha!"
Story-part31_6_3,"...Thank you, sect leader, for the name!"
Story-part31_6_4,"Thank you, hero, for stepping in. I am Yan Rurui, nice to meet you~"
Story-part31_6_5,"I am {PlayerName}, Miss Yan, you're welcome, this is what we, as chivalrous people, should do."
Story-part31_6_6,"So you are the sect leader of {PlayerSurName}! I have heard Duke Kang mention you many times, saying that you are a rare pillar of the country. In that case, I have a big favor to ask..."
Story-part31_6_7,"There's no need for such a big ceremony, Miss Yan, please get up quickly."
Story-part31_6_8,I beg the sect leader of {PlayerSurName} to persuade Duke Kang to help me get rid of my lowly status and restore my status as a good family.
Story-part31_6_9,"To persuade Duke Kang, we need to continue to improve our relations with him. Alright, I'll take care of this."
Story-part31_7_1,"Why is there never an end to the various things in the sect, forget it, I'll rest when I have time later..."
Story-part32_1_1,"Sect leader, after Duke Kang heard that you wanted to help Miss Yan get rid of her lowly status, he took the initiative to send someone to deliver the household registration certificate of Miss Yan's good family."
Story-part32_1_2,"Since Duke Kang is so considerate, we must immediately tell Miss Yan the good news."
Story-part32_name,A free person
Story-part32_log,"Duke Kang has delivered the good citizen registration coin book of Yan Rurui, you are ready to share the good news with her."
Story-part32_2_1,"{PlayerSurName}Why is the sect leader in such a hurry to find me, did you bring any good news~"
Story-part32_2_2,"Miss Yan, {PlayerSurName}I am honored to have successfully removed your lowly status."
Story-part32_2_3,"Here is the good citizen registration coin book, from now on, you are completely free."
Story-part32_2_4,"Thank you, {PlayerSurName}sect leader..."
Story-part32_2_5,"The matter is done, Miss Yan, enjoy your freedom, I will take my leave."
Story-part32_2_6,Wait!
Story-part32_2_7,{PlayerName}Young Master... Will you take me with you?
Story-part32_2_8,"Miss Yan, you are free now, you can go wherever you want."
Story-part32_2_9,"No... Over the years, I have passed by countless men, only you care about me, you are different from other stinky men!"
Story-part32_2_10,"I don't care if you have other lovers, I just want to stay by your side, I don't want to stay in this dirty place anymore."
Story-part32_2_11,"(Miss Yan seems to trust me very much, should I agree to take her away from the Maiden House?)"
Story-part32_op_1_1,Refuse
Story-part32_op_1_2,Agree
Story-part32_3_1,"Our sect often involves in martial arts disputes, it's too dangerous for Miss Yan to be with me."
Story-part32_3_2,"In that case, I will no longer bother you.\nI wish you to meet a good person, grow old together..."
Story-part32_3_3,"This Phoenix jade ornament is my lucky charm, please accept it, {PlayerSurName}sect leader."
Story-part32_3_4,"The road of martial arts is long, please take care, {PlayerSurName}..."
Story-part32_4_1,"Then, on behalf of {MyFaction}, I welcome Miss Yan to join us!"
Story-part32_4_2,"{PlayerGivenName}Young Master, please guide me~"
Story-part32_5_1,"Damn, I forgot to give the registration coin book to Miss Yan, I hope it's not too late..."
Story-part32_5_2,"Sect leader, Miss Yan has been waiting for you for a long time, she seems to have moved away and gone somewhere else."
Story-part32_5_3,"Ah, this is my fault..."
Story-part33_1_1,"Sect Leader, Duke Kang is here to visit!"
Story-part33_1_2,{PlayerSurName} pays his respects to your Highness.
Story-part33_1_3,"{PlayerSurName}Sect leader, no need to be so polite, I have no important matters today."
Story-part33_1_4,"It's just that my sister, the princess, heard too much about the heroic deeds of your sect and insisted on coming to explore, I am just accompanying her."
Story-part33_1_5,"What are you talking about, Wang? We agreed not to expose my little thoughts, hmph!"
Story-part33_1_6,"{PlayerSurName}Sect leader, Princess Fuqing specifically asked for your company, please show her around your sect."
Story-part33_name,Curious Princess
Story-part33_log,"Princess Fuqing came to your sect, specifically asking for your company."
Story-part33_2_1,"Perhaps because she was raised in the palace since she was a child,\nThis Princess Fuqing is innocent and lively,\nShe is full of curiosity about everything in the sect,\nAnd keeps dragging you around..."
Story-part33_2_2,"Hey, why are there so many wooden men here, are they for playing house?"
Story-part33_2_3,"Replying to the princess, this is our sect's training room. These wooden men are made according to the proportions of the spiritual master, specifically for disciples to practice."
Story-part33_2_4,"Practice? So they must be very durable, can I try!"
Story-part33_2_5,"(The princess is a rich lady, she can't be hurt at all, but if I don't agree with her, she will definitely be unhappy... Should I agree?)"
Story-part33_op_1_1,"Absolutely not, these wooden men are too dangerous"
Story-part33_op_1_2,"Of course, if the princess wants to try, she can."
Story-part33_3_1,"Absolutely not, these wooden dummies are too dangerous and could easily harm the princess!"
Story-part33_3_2,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader, you're so boring, just like Wang, always managing this and that, hmph!"
Story-part33_3_3,"{PlayerSurName} I'm just considering the safety of the princess, please forgive me."
Story-part33_3_4,"Princess, please follow {PlayerSurName} me to the sect's kitchen."
Story-part33_4_1,"Of course, as long as the princess is willing, you can try if you want."
Story-part33_4_2,"Please be careful, Mr. Wooden Dummy, it might hurt a bit..."
Story-part33_4_3,Hey... Ha!
Story-part33_4_4,What! The special wooden dummy for training was shattered by her punch!
Story-part33_4_5,"Princess, you truly have Herculean strength... I admire, admire..."
Story-part33_4_6,"Fun, fun, can I hit another one?"
Story-part33_4_7,"...Princess, please follow {PlayerSurName} me to the sect's kitchen, there are more fun things there."
Story-part33_5_1,"Princess, this is the kitchen of our sect."
Story-part33_5_2,"Wow, it's no wonder that the heroes of the martial arts world use such a big iron pot to cook!"
Story-part33_5_3,"Because our sect has many disciples, the efficiency of cooking with ordinary iron pots is too low, so we use this big pot, which can cook meals for about ten people at a time."
Story-part33_5_4,"This is really fun, can I try to stir-fry with this big pot?"
Story-part33_op_2_1,"Princess, please be merciful, if the pot is broken, we won't have food to eat!"
Story-part33_op_2_2,"As long as the princess finds it fun, there's naturally no problem."
Story-part33_6_1,"Princess, please be merciful, if the pot is broken, we won't have food to eat!"
Story-part33_6_2,"Ah, this is not allowed either..."
Story-part33_6_3,"Sorry, this pot is indeed the most important thing in our sect, I hope the princess will forgive us."
Story-part33_6_4,"Oh no, I think I heard my brother calling me, {PlayerSurName} Leader, let's go over quickly."
Story-part33_6_5,"Princess, please follow me."
Story-part33_7_1,"As long as the princess finds it fun, there's naturally no problem."
Story-part33_7_2,"Hey, I, the princess, am going to cook! It's a good chance to test the cooking mantra taught to me by the cooks in the palace!"
Story-part33_7_3,"Heat the pot first, then the oil, star anise and pepper in the oil!"
Story-part33_7_4,"Fry the slices of green onion, ginger, and garlic first, then add the ingredients!"
Story-part33_7_5,"Fry the meat first, then add the vegetables, toss the pot three times, and you won't have to worry about the flavor, worry..."
Story-part33_7_6,"It's over, I accidentally broke the handle of the big iron pot, {PlayerSurName} Leader, you won't blame me, will you..."
Story-part33_7_7,"...It's okay, it's just a pot, our disciples can go buy another one!"
Story-part33_7_8,"Okay, then I'm relieved~"
Story-part33_7_9,"Oh no, I think I heard my brother calling me, {PlayerSurName} Leader, let's go over quickly."
Story-part33_7_10,"Princess, please follow me."
Story-part33_8_1,"My dear sister, how do you feel about this {MyFaction} after touring around, does it feel like the martial arts sect you imagined?"
Story-part33_9_1,"Brother, it's not only fun here, {PlayerSurName} Leader also takes good care of me. Unlike in the palace, it's so boring no matter how I stay... I think..."
Story-part33_9_2,What are you thinking?
Story-part33_9_3,"I want to stay in {MyFaction} for a while longer to experience the life of the martial arts world, please grant me this wish, brother!"
Story-part33_9_4,Hahahaha! You're truly my dear sister!
Story-part33_9_5,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, I plan to fulfill Fuqing's wish and entrust her to you for a while, are you willing?"
Story-part33_9_6,Having the princess visit is naturally an honor for our sect.
Story-part33_9_7,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, remember to tell me your heroic stories~"
Story-part33_10_1,"Brother Wang, it's not as fun as I imagined here, {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader is just like you, always managing this and that, it's so boring!"
Story-part33_10_2,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, as the head of a sect, naturally can't accompany you to mess around everywhere."
Story-part33_10_3,"Now that you've experienced what it's like to be in a martial arts sect, let's go back to Lin'an together."
Story-part33_10_4,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader, I have been bothering you a lot recently. These things can be considered as some compensation from me."
Story-part33_11_1,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, I know you're busy with sect affairs, but surely you can spare some time to accompany the princess, right?"
Story-part33_11_2,"Your Highness, I apologize, {PlayerSurName} I really didn't mean to neglect you and the princess..."
Story-part34_1_1,"Sect Leader, although Jiujiang Fortress has been destroyed, the Ding siblings, who are a major threat to Duke Kang, have not been arrested."
Story-part34_1_2,"Today, there is news from the city that Ding Haitang has somehow been separated from Ding Fengbo and has appeared alone in a tavern."
Story-part34_1_3,"The city's constables have surrounded the tavern, but they dare not act. If our sect wants to get involved, please make a decision quickly."
Story-part34_name,The Crisis of Haitang
Story-part34_log,Ding Haitang has appeared alone for some reason and is trapped by the city's constables.
Story-part34_2_1,What's the situation inside the tavern now?
Story-part34_2_2,"This woman is quite skilled, she took down five or six of our brothers who went in earlier, taking advantage of the terrain."
Story-part34_2_3,"The Prefect is considerate of us, he ordered us to surround the tavern without attacking, hoping to starve her into submission."
Story-part34_2_4,"But this woman is tough as nails, she hasn't eaten, drunk or slept for three days, and she's still fierce in combat."
Story-part34_2_5,"We want to continue the siege, but we're worried that her brother Ding Fengbo will come to provide combat support. If it weren't for your sect's arrival, we really wouldn't know what to do."
Story-part34_2_6,"I understand the situation, leave the rest to us."
Story-part34_2_7,"Listen up, you dogs of the court who have come in!"
Story-part34_2_8,"Although I haven't eaten or slept for three days, I'm still full of energy and ready to fight you."
Story-part34_2_9,"I suggest you leave as soon as possible, otherwise, when my brother comes, you'll be seeking your own death!"
Story-part34_2_10,"(I didn't expect Ding Haitang, a woman, to be so bold and domineering, what should I say?)"
Story-part34_op_1_1,"You audacious pirate, surrender now!"
Story-part34_op_1_2,"Miss Ding, you are bold and domineering, let me help you!"
Story-part34_3_1,"You audacious pirate, still dare to brag here, surrender now!"
Story-part34_3_2,"If you have the guts, come up the stairs and let me teach you a lesson!"
Story-part34_4_1,"I underestimated the enemy, let's retreat from the tavern quickly..."
Story-part34_5_1,"Hmph, so you've been running on fumes, just barely holding on with sheer willpower."
Story-part34_5_2,"I'll hand you over to Duke Kang first, don't worry, Ding Fengbo will see you soon!"
Story-part34_6_1,"Miss Ding, you are bold and domineering, let's break out of the tavern together, I'll cover you."
Story-part34_6_2,"You're from {MyFaction}... traitor, you can't fool me with such tricks!"
Story-part34_6_3,"Miss Ding, the past grudges between our two families were just for our respective masters. In today's situation, if you don't trust me, you will definitely be captured."
Story-part34_6_4,"Fine, I'll trust you this time... Lead the way!"
Story-part34_6_5,Am I seeing things... Why is the hero {MyFaction} rushing out with that female bandit? Could it be an imposter?
Story-part34_6_6,"Stop! Brothers, stop them!"
Story-part34_7_1,"Don't worry about me, just go!"
Story-part34_7_2,"To have met a friend like you who would risk their life for me before I die, I consider myself fortunate..."
Story-part34_7_3,"We can't keep fighting, let's retreat..."
Story-part34_8_1,That was a great fight!
Story-part34_8_2,"Hurry up, these constables' martial arts skills are limited. If we alert the Crime Investigation Bureau or Duke Kang's people, we won't be able to escape."
Story-part34_8_3,"Jiujiang Fortress has been destroyed, and I've lost my brother... Where else can I go..."
Story-part34_8_4,You can come back to {MyFaction} with me.
Story-part34_8_5,{MyFaction}? Would you dare to risk offending Duke Kang for me?
Story-part34_8_6,"What Duke Kang fears is the power of Jiujiang Fortress, not two bandits like you. We don't have much time, let's go to my sect for now."
Story-part34_8_7,"Fine, I'll trust you one more time!"
Story-part34_8_8,I don't like owing people. This exclusive manual is a token of my gratitude for your help.
Story-part34_9_1,"Master, Ding Haitang held on for a long time, but she couldn't resist any longer and was captured by the officials."
Story-part34_9_2,Our sect has other important matters to attend to. Let's leave the capture of the Ding siblings to the officials and Duke Kang.
Story-part35_1_1,"Miss Ding, what's the matter? Why are you in such a hurry?"
Story-part35_1_2,"Master {PlayerSurName}, I heard my brother's unique bamboo whistle today. The sound was high three times and low once, long twice and short once, which is his signal for seeking a way to save me."
Story-part35_1_3,"But what worries me is that I don't have a bamboo whistle to signal that I'm safe. If he misunderstands and thinks I've been kidnapped by you and breaks into the sect at night, what should we do?"
Story-part35_1_4,"Don't worry, I'll have our elite disciples patrol day and night. As soon as he appears, we'll know immediately."
Story-part35_name,Ding Fengbo's determination
Story-part35_log,Ding Fengbo mistakenly believes that your sect has kidnapped Ding Haitang and is looking for an opportunity to sneak into the sect.
Story-part35_2_1,I didn't expect such a heavy rain tonight...
Story-part35_2_2,"Heavy rain not only makes the soil muddy and leaves footprints, but also makes the walls slippery, affecting the performance of Qinggong."
Story-part35_2_3,"If I were Ding Fengbo, I would definitely not choose this kind of weather to sneak into our sect."
Story-part35_2_4,"Master, something terrible has happened..."
Story-part35_2_5,What's the rush? What happened?
Story-part35_2_6,Several of our patrolling disciples were knocked out by someone. One of them has been revived after emergency treatment and said he saw a shadow heading towards Miss Ding Haitang's residence.
Story-part35_2_7,"Although Ding Fengbo would never hurt Miss Haitang, he might attack other disciples who are watching her residence. You guys go and warn them!"
Story-part35_2_8,"Yes, sir!"
Story-part35_2_9,"This Ding Fengbo is really bold and talented. Even in such severe weather, he dares to sneak into our sect and hurt people..."
Story-part35_2_10,"Hmph, not only am I bold and talented, but I also know how to catch you off guard. You rule-following fools, how could you possibly be a match for me."
Story-part35_2_11,Creating chaos on purpose to distract the gatekeeping disciples outside the master's room... What a good plan.
Story-part35_2_12,"But there's one thing I don't understand, master. Why did you create the illusion of going to Miss Haitang's residence, but instead sneak into my room?"
Story-part35_2_13,"Hahaha! At that time, I knew very well that if I didn't get rid of you, even if I saved Haitang first, I would still be caught in an endless pursuit. It's better to capture the leader first, let you {{MyFaction}} be in chaos, and then escape!"
Story-part35_2_14,"Miss Haitang was right, you are indeed meticulous despite your rough exterior. Unfortunately, you got one thing wrong. Our sect not only did not kidnap Miss Haitang, but also painstakingly rescued her from the government."
Story-part35_2_15,"Don't try to fool me, talking is useless, let's fight!"
Story-part35_3_1,"I didn't expect this Ding Fengbo to come with determination, every move is aimed at mutual destruction, and I am restrained, under this situation, I am obviously at a disadvantage..."
Story-part35_3_2,"Sect leader? Someone, there's an assassination attempt on the sect leader!"
Story-part35_3_3,"I didn't expect to fail at the last moment, huh, revenge is not too late for ten years, you wait for me!"
Story-part35_3_4,"Unfortunately, Ding Fengbo thought that I was prepared and would not act rashly afterwards..."
Story-part35_4_1,"Ding Fengbo, although your ambition is commendable, you are not a match for the sect leader after all."
Story-part35_4_2,"Stay here quietly, wait for Miss Haitang to come, and the truth will naturally be revealed."
Story-part35_4_3,"Aren't you afraid that I will fight you to the death, impulsive and reckless?"
Story-part35_4_4,"Afraid, of course, but what I'm afraid of is not my own life, but that you and your sister will be inseparable because of a misunderstanding."
Story-part35_4_5,"Humph, don't try to confuse me with such clumsy lies."
Story-part35_4_6,Brother! Are you okay?
Story-part35_4_7,Haitang? Could it be... everything this kid just said is true?
Story-part35_4_8,"After listening to Ding Haitang's explanation\nDing Fengbo first sighed\nThen he opened his chest, handed the treasure sword to you\nClearly willing to apologize with death"
Story-part35_4_9,"Sect leader Ding, you don't have to do this, after all, you didn't hurt {{PlayerSurName}} me."
Story-part35_4_10,"There is still a hunt for the two of you outside, in my opinion, you might as well join our sect. Even Duke Kang has to give face to the sect leader."
Story-part35_4_11,"Thank you, {{PlayerSurName}} sect leader, for your generosity. I am willing to join your sect and spare no effort!"
Story-part35_4_12,"This is the famous internal skill that I rely on to make a name for myself in the martial arts world. Since I have joined the sect, I dare not hide it, I hope the sect leader will accept it."
Story-part35_5_1,"The sect leader has been waiting for Ding Fengbo for two months, but there has been no movement. Could it be because our sect's defense is tight and he can't find a chance to strike?"
Story-part35_5_2,"Forget it, let's not worry about him, I still have a lot of things to do."
Story-part36_1_1,"Sect leader, a man claiming to be the clerk of King Chai is visiting."
Story-part36_1_2,"Could it be that King Chai has something else for our sect to do? Let him wait, the sect leader will see him later."
Story-part36_name,The cat changes the prince
Story-part36_log,"The clerk of King Chai suddenly visited, seemingly with important matters to entrust."
Story-part36_2_1,The sect leader is busy with affairs and has lost the courtesy of greeting. I wonder what the clerk is here for?
Story-part36_2_2,"King Chai had previously heard that Duke Qi, who was guarding Daliang, was colluding with foreigners and conspiring with the Yan people, so he sent me to search for evidence."
Story-part36_2_3,"After many days of hard work, I finally succeeded in my mission and found ironclad evidence that could ruin Duke Qi's reputation. However, I was assassinated by the Black Clothes Society on my way back and narrowly escaped death."
Story-part36_2_4,"I hope that {{PlayerSurName}} the sect leader can lend a helping hand, and King Chai will surely be grateful!"
Story-part36_2_5,"Oh? How do you hope I, the sect leader, can assist you?"
Story-part36_2_6,"I have a plan. Please, {PlayerSurName} leader, send someone to ride the horse carriage I brought and run away first. I will follow later with the ironclad evidence against Duke Qi."
Story-part36_2_7,"The assassins from the Xuan Yi Society only recognize the style of the horse carriage. They will never expect that the ones waiting for them in the carriage are the experts from your sect. In this way, I can escape in the chaos."
Story-part36_2_8,"What a clever plan! Since the evidence is crucial to King Chai, I, as the leader, will personally take the risk."
Story-part36_2_9,"You disguise yourself as a clerk and ride the horse carriage from Duke Chai's Tower, pretending to run away.\nThe first ten miles are unusually calm, making you doubt the truth of the clerk's words.\nBut when you reach twenty miles, you suddenly hear a scream from the coachman."
Story-part36_2_10,"Hand over the things you got in Daliang City, and I will spare your life. Otherwise, I will make sure you can't live or die!"
Story-part36_2_11,What if the things are not with me?
Story-part36_2_12,"Don't worry, if you die by the hand of the leader of the Xuan Yi Society, you won't feel a thing!"
Story-part36_3_1,"Wait, you're not the clerk, you're the leader of {MyFaction}'s {PlayerSurName}!"
Story-part36_3_2,You're indeed the leader of the Xuan Yi Society. I'm no match for you. Take advantage of her surprise and run away...
Story-part36_4_1,"Wait, you're not the clerk, you're the leader of {MyFaction}'s {PlayerSurName}!"
Story-part36_4_2,I didn't expect that Yi Zhihua from the prestigious Zhangyue Casino is actually an assassin from the Xuan Yi Society under Duke Qi.
Story-part36_4_3,I have no grudges with you in the past or present. We are just serving our masters. You can go.
Story-part36_4_4,Go? Where do you think I can go...
Story-part36_4_5,"Duke Qi is outwardly gentle but inwardly harsh. If I don't complete the mission and retrieve the evidence, I will surely die when I return. I'd rather you kill me quickly. At least I can give Duke Qi an explanation..."
Story-part36_4_6,It would be a pity if someone as talented as Sister Hua were to die. How about staying in our sect?
Story-part36_4_7,Stay in your sect? You must be joking!
Story-part36_4_8,"Although I can't betray King Chai and help you retrieve the evidence, I can certainly protect and shelter you. Think about it."
Story-part36_4_9,……
Story-part36_4_10,What you said is indeed a way out...
Story-part36_4_11,"But I, Sister Hua, always trust fate, not people. Let's do this, I'll roll two dice. Two to six is small, seven to twelve is big. If you can guess right, I'll agree to stay in your sect. Otherwise, I'm afraid I can't comply."
Story-part36_4_12,"Come on, take a guess and see what my fate is."
Story-part36_4_13,"(Just now, I was fully focused on auditory sight. It should be the one and five sides of the dice that landed. Is it big or small? Let me think...)"
Story-part36_op_1_1,Small
Story-part36_op_1_2,Big
Story-part36_5_1,"I'm tired of calculating, I guess it's small!"
Story-part36_5_2,Six and two make eight... It seems that I am destined not to stay in your sect. Goodbye...
Story-part36_6_1,"(The sum of the opposite sides of the dice is seven. Since I heard that the one and five sides landed, the numbers rolled must be six and two, which add up to eight. It's big!)"
Story-part36_6_2,I guess it's big!
Story-part36_6_3,"Six and two make eight... If this is the will of heaven, then I ask {PlayerSurName} leader to take good care of me."
Story-part36_6_4,This Killer's Secret Manual is useless to me. I'll give it to your sect as a gift.
Story-part36_7_1,"Leader, the clerk from King Chai has been waiting for you for a long time. He had no choice but to ride the horse carriage and leave. He was assassinated by the Xuan Yi Society not far from our sect."
Story-part36_7_2,Ah... How could I forget about this? This will surely offend King Chai.
Story-part37_1_1,"Headmaster, Prince Chai has suddenly arrived with a young swordsman!"
Story-part37_1_2,"This is really not a good time... You go and entertain them first, and I will come as soon as I finish my work."
Story-part37_name,Young Swordsman
Story-part37_log,"Prince Chai has suddenly arrived with a young swordsman, I wonder what his intentions are."
Story-part37_2_1,{PlayerSurName} I pay my respects to Prince Chai.
Story-part37_2_2,I came here this time to introduce a young swordsman to Headmaster {PlayerSurName}.
Story-part37_2_3,"I am Liao Yuelong, please give me your guidance!"
Story-part37_2_4,This brother Liao is a good man from the rivers and lakes who recently joined me. What do you think of his talent and roots?
Story-part37_2_5,"Brother Liao has a restrained spirit and an elegant posture, he must be a good seedling for practicing swordsmanship."
Story-part37_2_6,Headmaster {PlayerSurName} really has a good eye!
Story-part37_2_7,"{MyFaction} has been working for me recently and has been very diligent. Naturally, I can't just sit back and enjoy the benefits, so I want to let this talented Brother Liao join your sect to help Headmaster {PlayerSurName}."
Story-part37_2_8,"(Is Prince Chai's behavior to provide talent for our sect, or to plant a nail in our sect, should I agree?)"
Story-part37_op_1_1,Refuse
Story-part37_op_1_2,Agree
Story-part37_3_1,"I appreciate your kindness, {PlayerSurName}, but our sect has too many rules, I'm afraid Brother Liao may not be able to adapt, please take back your order."
Story-part37_3_2,Hmph...
Story-part37_3_3,"Yuelong, you are so confident, but Headmaster {PlayerSurName} doesn't even look at you."
Story-part37_3_4,"Forget it, I won't force anyone, I'll take my leave."
Story-part37_4_1,"Since Your Highness is willing to let Brother Liao join our sect, {PlayerSurName} I dare not refuse."
Story-part37_4_2,"Yuelong, did you hear that? Hurry up and pay your respects to the headmaster!"
Story-part37_4_3,I dare to ask Headmaster {PlayerSurName} to promise me one thing first!
Story-part37_4_4,"No problem, take your time."
Story-part37_4_5,"When I was young, my family was suddenly robbed, and the real culprit has not been found... As long as Headmaster {PlayerSurName} promises to help find the real culprit in the future, I will be at your disposal without any complaints!"
Story-part37_4_6,"Such a matter of loyalty and filial piety, I will definitely take it upon myself."
Story-part37_4_7,Liao Yuelong pays respects to the headmaster!
Story-part37_4_8,"Good! Bring the wine, I want to celebrate for you."
Story-part37_5_1,"Headmaster, Prince Chai has been waiting for you in the guest hall all the time, and finally left with a pale face."
Story-part37_5_2,Ah... How could I forget about this? This will surely offend King Chai.
Story-part38_1_1,"Headmaster, although Tiger Escort has been destroyed, the elite escort Han Hongyu, who was ordered by Prince Chai to be arrested, has not been brought to justice."
Story-part38_1_2,"A disciple sent a message saying that Han Hongyu is now poor and down, and is actually doing a day's bodyguard work outside the casino in that small town."
Story-part38_1_3,What is a day's bodyguard?
Story-part38_1_4,"It is to put up a sign outside the casino saying ""One day's bodyguard, safe to home"", specifically serving those who win money in the casino and show off, sending them home safely."
Story-part38_1_5,"Since she is willing to do this lowly job that ordinary escort lieutenants despise, there must be some unspeakable difficulties. Send someone to check it out."
Story-part38_name,One Day Bodyguard
Story-part38_log,Han Hongyu is wanted by Prince Chai and has no choice but to do the lowly job of a one-day bodyguard.
Story-part38_2_1,One day bodyguard... safe to home...
Story-part38_2_2,"This should be the place where Han Hongyu takes on the job of a one-day bodyguard, strange, why is there no one here?"
Story-part38_2_3,"Is this gentleman here to win big money and ask Miss Hong for a ""safe return home""?"
Story-part38_2_4,"(Miss Hong? Yes, since she's wanted by King Chai, she must have changed her name in her daily life)"
Story-part38_2_5,"Excuse me, young man, why isn't Miss Hong here? I'm in a hurry to go home, afraid of being robbed by villains."
Story-part38_2_6,"You're a step too late. Miss Hong was just invited away. The Master who invited her looks strong, but he asked a weak woman to escort him. It's really strange."
Story-part38_2_7,(Something is wrong. Could someone have recognized her identity and is planning to trap her and present her to King Chai? Should I follow and get involved...)
Story-part38_op_1_1,"Our faction is already working for King Chai, no need to do more."
Story-part38_op_1_2,Why is King Chai so against a woman? Let's go and see.
Story-part38_3_1,"Our faction is already working for King Chai, go back, no need to do more."
Story-part38_4_1,"King Chai has repeatedly targeted a woman, which is too cruel. Let's go and see."
Story-part38_4_2,"Thinking of this, you suddenly feel a little sympathy.\nAfter asking the Gambler about Han Hongyu's location,\nyou immediately speed up with Qinggong.\nUnexpectedly, you encounter a bizarre ambush halfway."
Story-part38_4_3,"Miss Hong, no, Han Elite Escort, since you've fallen into our hands, it's better to surrender."
Story-part38_4_4,"If you fight and get hurt, the reward from Chai Wangye will be less!"
Story-part38_4_5,I was wondering why a person like you in the martial arts world would need a bodyguard escort. It turns out it was just a trap set for me.
Story-part38_4_6,"Although I know I will lose this battle, I will still resist with all my might. Please be prepared..."
Story-part38_4_7,"Cut... a vain woman who wants to save face, brothers, get her!"
Story-part38_4_8,"(Han Elite Escort is in such a desperate situation, but she is still so determined and strong. It's not easy. Should I save this heroine...)"
Story-part38_op_2_1,"Don't risk offending King Chai, forget it."
Story-part38_op_2_2,"Forget King Chai, I must save this person."
Story-part38_5_1,"Don't risk offending King Chai, forget it."
Story-part38_6_1,"Forget King Chai, I must save this person!"
Story-part38_6_2,"Han Elite Escort, don't panic, reinforcements are here!"
Story-part38_6_3,！……
Story-part38_6_4,"Where did this bird come from? Brothers, get him!"
Story-part38_7_1,Damn... I was too busy playing the hero and underestimated these people's strength...
Story-part38_7_2,"If I continue to fight, not to mention saving Han Elite Escort, I can't even save myself. I should retreat first..."
Story-part38_8_1,"Although you are from {MyFaction}, I am very grateful for your help this time."
Story-part38_8_2,"Han Elite Escort, don't be polite. The previous conflict between you and me was just for our own masters."
Story-part38_8_3,"Han Elite Escort... haha, Tiger Escort is gone. What's the difference between me now and a homeless dog?"
Story-part38_8_4,"If it weren't for the fact that I haven't paid off the severance pay for those old clerks in the escort agency, I might have killed myself long ago. Where would I do this lowly job of being a bodyguard for a day!"
Story-part38_8_5,This One Blade is the only valuable thing I have. I'll give it to you as a thank you for saving my life. I have to continue raising money for the clerks' severance pay. Goodbye.
Story-part38_8_6,"Wait, how much is the remaining severance pay?"
Story-part38_8_7,About 10000 coins.
Story-part38_op_3_1,I was just asking casually.
Story-part38_op_3_2,The sect will cover this money for you! (10000 Coin)
Story-part38_9_1,"No worries, I was just asking..."
Story-part38_9_2,"Han Biao... Miss Han Hongyu, the martial world is vast, please take care!"
Story-part38_10_1,"Don't worry, Han Elite Escort, our sect will cover the cost."
Story-part38_10_2,How could I possibly accept this...
Story-part38_10_3,"Well then, consider this money as a loan to me. Until I pay it back, I will temporarily join your sect and follow your orders!"
Story-part38_11_1,"Leader, after Han Hongyu took a one-day Bodyguard job, she suddenly disappeared. I wonder if she was caught by Chai Wang."
Story-part38_11_2,"This matter has nothing to do with our sect, just let it be."
Story-part39_1_1,"Leader, I have a friend in the Western Regions who is in trouble recently, could you send someone to help?"
Story-part39_1_2,"She used to live in seclusion in a valley, not caring about worldly affairs. But recently, for some reason, a large number of bandits have invaded the valley, constantly spying and harassing."
Story-part39_1_3,"No problem, I, as the sect leader, will personally take care of it."
Story-part39_name,Red Skull
Story-part39_log,"Han Hongyu's friend lives in a secluded valley, but is harassed by bandits."
Story-part39_2_1,I didn't expect such a beautiful valley to be here...
Story-part39_2_2,"Living in such a remote place and still being harassed by men, Han Elite Escort's friend must be a beauty."
Story-part39_2_3,"Am I seeing things? There's a stunning foreign beauty ahead, surrounded by a group of Soldiers."
Story-part39_2_4,Do you think I'm beautiful~
Story-part39_2_5,Beautiful... too beautiful... so beautiful it makes my heart itch...
Story-part39_2_6,"Since you think I'm beautiful, why don't you all stay and keep me company~"
Story-part39_2_7,"Such a beauty... I, I would love to!"
Story-part39_2_8,"Then I'll do as you wish, bury you all between this Blue Mountain and green water, so you won't have died in vain~"
Story-part39_2_9,"A bunch of useless men, attracted by such a small trick, wake up, all of you!"
Story-part39_2_10,"Oh, is the General trying to be like Liuxia Hui, remaining calm and composed~"
Story-part39_2_11,"Shut up! I only care about fame and fortune, how could I be charmed by a fox spirit like you?"
Story-part39_2_12,"But... it's a waste for a beauty like you to hide in the mountains. If I present you to Lord Chai Wang, when he ascends the throne in the future, how could he forget my contribution?"
Story-part39_2_13,"Stop daydreaming, you stinky men, bring it on!"
Story-part39_2_14,"Not all men are bad! Miss, I'm here to help you!"
Story-part39_3_1,"After all, they are organized imperial Soldiers, we are outnumbered, we should retreat back to the sect..."
Story-part39_4_1,Did you help me because you have ulterior motives?
Story-part39_4_2,"Miss, you're a bit sensitive... I'm here to help you at the request of Han Elite Escort."
Story-part39_4_3,Hongyu? I've been worried that she couldn't recover after the fall of Tiger Escort... Tell me where she is now!
Story-part39_4_4,"She's doing well in our {MyFaction}, her mental state is very good."
Story-part39_4_5,"I see you can't stay here for long, how about joining our sect?"
Story-part39_4_6,"Hongyu's judgement can't be wrong, I, Man Tuoluo, pay my respects to the sect leader!"
Story-part39_5_1,"Leader, my friend suddenly disappeared in that valley, I wonder if she's hiding again..."
Story-part39_5_2,"It must be so, don't worry too much."
Story-part40_1_1,"Leader, the head of Swallow Nest, Bu Juechen, is here to see you."
Story-part40_1_2,"Wrong, not the head, the former head."
Story-part40_1_3,"Swallow Nest has already been destroyed, the so-called leader is a thing of the past, not worth a sneer."
Story-part40_1_4,"Leader Bu, I've always been worried about you... Qingqing doesn't want to lose another elder who has been kind to me!"
Story-part40_1_5,"Hey, you little duckling, long time no see, you've even learned to hurt people, haha!"
Story-part40_1_6,I don't know how much effort the leader {PlayerSurName} has put into taking care of you.
Story-part40_1_7,"Humph, I've been behaving myself~"
Story-part40_1_8,"I wonder what Brother Bu plans to do next? If there's anything our sect can help with, just say the word."
Story-part40_1_9,The only plan I have next is to bother your sect.
Story-part40_1_10,"But don't flatter yourself, Leader {PlayerSurName}, I'm only doing this to spend more time with Qingqing."
Story-part40_1_11,"What are you talking about, Brother Bu? We'd love for you to stay longer."
Story-part40_1_12,"Anyway, I won't stay for free. Swallow Nest is gone, this Celestial Lady Scattering Flowers manual has lost its meaning, I'll give it to your sect."
Story-part40_1_13,"Thank you for the manual, Brother Bu! Our sect will make good use of it!"
Story-part41_1_1,"Leader, Constable Luo from the Crime Investigation Bureau is here to see you."
Story-part41_1_2,I heard that {MyFaction} has become a famous martial arts sect under the leadership of {PlayerSurName}.
Story-part41_1_3,"Compared to that, I, Luo, have ruined the Crime Investigation Bureau because of my lack of ambition and stubbornness. I'm really ashamed..."
Story-part41_1_4,"Brother, don't say that... This is definitely not your fault!"
Story-part41_1_5,"Qianxue, you haven't disappointed me in these years at {MyFaction}."
Story-part41_1_6,"It seems that Leader {PlayerSurName} is doing a better job than me, your own brother, in training you."
Story-part41_1_7,Brother... You really should thank {PlayerGivenName} for this...
Story-part41_1_8,"I wonder what Constable Luo plans to do next? If there's anything our sect can help with, just say the word."
Story-part41_1_9,"To be honest, I've been feeling a bit disheartened lately and haven't thought about it. I just came to your sect because I've been missing Qianxue."
Story-part41_1_10,"If you two don't mind, I'd like to stay here for a while and learn from Leader {PlayerSurName} on how to be a good brother."
Story-part41_1_11,"Constable Luo, you're too modest. You're welcome to stay as long as you like. Qianxue and I would love for you to stay longer."
Story-part41_1_12,This Prayer Manual was originally a secret of the Crime Investigation Bureau. Now it seems ironically fitting. Take it to enrich your sect's martial arts.
Story-part41_1_13,"Thank you for the manual, Constable Luo! Our sect will make good use of it!"
Story-part42_1_1,"Leader, a crazy wandering monk just broke into our kitchen, saying something about life and death and asking for medicine, but he grabbed a handful of Milk snow cake from the food box."
Story-part42_1_2,"The disciples were about to stop him, but they didn't expect the monk to be a martial arts expert. He escaped, and unfortunately, we lost the freshly bought Milk snow cakes..."
Story-part42_1_3,"It's just some Milk snow cakes, let the monk take them. I'm more interested in the medicine he was asking for."
Story-part42_name,Mad monk asking for medicine.
Story-part42_log,"A mad monk, under the guise of fetching medicine for others, has stolen the Milk snow cake from your sect."
Story-part42_2_1,"Driven by curiosity, you use Qinggong to chase after him\nFollowing the mad monk, you arrive at the mansion of a wealthy family."
Story-part42_2_2,(Such a strong smell of medicine... It seems that this mad monk's words are indeed true.)
Story-part42_2_3,"Who goes there, halt!"
Story-part42_2_4,"I'm with the master who just came, helping him out."
Story-part42_2_5,"Alas, Lady is really desperate, actually letting a mad monk and a pretty boy treat Master's tongue paralysis..."
Story-part42_2_6,"Following the direction of the medicinal smell, you should be able to find that mad monk."
Story-part42_2_7,"I have already prepared the extremely bitter herbs such as coptis, Dragon Courage grass, bitter gourd, mountain bean root, and bitter admonishment skin into a soup according to the prescription given by the master..."
Story-part42_2_8,And... also added a lot of human... according to the master's instructions.
Story-part42_2_9,"No need to mention this medicine. Since it's been made into a soup, why not let the donor drink it?"
Story-part42_2_10,That's because Master he...
Story-part42_2_11,"Master, please show some mercy! This medicine is really not for humans to drink. I just took a sip and almost vomited my gallbladder!"
Story-part42_2_12,"Buddha said, good medicine tastes bitter. If you are unwilling to endure hardship, then the monk can only let you taste some bitterness."
Story-part42_2_13,"Let the monk see who can help... Hey, you, come here."
Story-part42_2_14,"Master, are you calling me?"
Story-part42_2_15,"Nonsense, if it's not you, who else could it be? You help the monk hold this benefactor down, and I'll pour the Six Bitter Soup down his throat, hehe!"
Story-part42_2_16,"(This healing method is really unthinkable, should I help or not?)"
Story-part42_op_1_1,Don't help.
Story-part42_op_1_2,Help
Story-part42_3_1,"This bowl of Soup is probably more bitter than Meng Po's Soup, can you still survive after drinking it?"
Story-part42_3_2,Is it the monk who's treating you or you? Get out of here!
Story-part42_3_3,"Ahahaha, it's time for you to take your medicine, benefactor~"
Story-part42_4_1,"This monk seems to be talking nonsense, but in fact, he is proficient in medicine and prescribes the right medicine for the disease."
Story-part42_4_2,"Master, I have offended you!"
Story-part42_5_1,Help... life... gulp gulp gulp...
Story-part42_5_2,"How is it, tastes good, right? Hey, don't stop talking, are you mute?"
Story-part42_5_3,"This master is already so bitter that he can't speak, master, don't make it hard for him."
Story-part42_5_4,"It's good to be bitter! It's good to be bitter! The soup just now was just a primer, now swallow this main medicine in one gulp. How about it, can you taste the sweetness?"
Story-part42_5_5,"Sweet... so sweet! Master, you are really a god! I can taste again!"
Story-part42_5_6,"Whether it's the thorough bitterness just now or the lingering sweetness now... What kind of miracle drug is this, it's simply a cure!"
Story-part42_5_7,"The medicine just now was powerful, called Healing Ointment, a treasure that has been treasured by {PlayerSurName}, the head of my side for many years. Hey, Master is asking you, why don't you introduce it?"
Story-part42_op_2_1,It's just a piece of ordinary Milk Snow Cake...
Story-part42_op_2_2,"This Healing Ointment is more than powerful, it's simply a cure-all!"
Story-part42_6_1,It's just a piece of ordinary Milk Snow Cake...
Story-part42_6_2,"{PlayerSurName}, you really know how to joke. If it's just an ordinary cake, how could it cure my taste loss that has troubled me for ten years."
Story-part42_7_1,"What the master said is true, this Healing Ointment is made from ninety-nine and eighty-one precious herbs, and it is specially used to treat various difficult and complicated diseases."
Story-part42_7_2,"Ah, how can I use such a precious thing for free? Lady, quickly take out some Gold from the treasury to thank the two!"
Story-part42_8_1,"Since the disease is cured, you and Lai Toudian walked out of this mansion one after the other."
Story-part42_8_2,"Unexpectedly, the master has long recognized {PlayerSurName}, I wonder which temple the master is from, and what is his Dharma name?"
Story-part42_8_3,"Hey, the monk is Lai Toudian from Shifa Temple, who specializes in madness and laughs at the world."
Story-part42_9_1,"The monk has been wandering the rivers and lakes for many years, and has never met such an interesting person like you."
Story-part42_9_2,"Walking the rivers and lakes, there are times when one gets tired. The monk now wants to rest in {MyFaction}, what do you think?"
Story-part42_9_3,"The master appears crazy on the surface, but he is compassionate at heart. Although our sect is not a temple, we welcome virtuous people like you."
Story-part42_10_1,"The monk originally heard that you were interesting, but didn't expect you to be so boring."
Story-part42_10_2,"Meeting is fate, but no fate is better than fate, let's go."
Story-part42_10_3,"This master is crazy and weird, just let him go."
Story-part42_11_1,"Leader, it is said that the crazy monk has cured many difficult diseases with strange methods. People want to build a monument and temple for him, but he ran away without a trace."
Story-part42_11_2,"What a weirdo, forget about him."
Story-part43_1_1,"Leader, since our sect has radiated its influence to Chuxiang City, many wealthy families in the city have been vying to curry favor, but you have never met them."
Story-part43_1_2,"The city is about to hold its annual wine tasting event, and the owners of various wineries have visited three times, insisting on inviting you to be a judge."
Story-part43_1_3,"No good deed goes unpunished, I, the leader, understand."
Story-part43_name,Chuxiang Wine Tasting
Story-part43_log,"The wine tasting event is about to be held in Chuxiang City, and the owners of various wineries have specially invited you to participate."
Story-part43_2_1,You took time out of your busy schedule to rush to the wine tasting venue in Chuxiang City.
Story-part43_2_2,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, our Ningde Winery's Jade Pot Spring is dense and can be called a top-notch wine. Please taste it."
Story-part43_2_3,"It melts in the mouth and is fragrant, it's really good wine."
Story-part43_2_4,"Although the Thousand Cups Drunk from Ding's Winery is mellow, it is not easy to get drunk. You must not miss it!"
Story-part43_2_5,"Well, it's not bad either."
Story-part43_2_6,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, our Desheng Winery has recently developed a new type of loquat wine called Formation Breaker. Because it is not easy to brew, we have only succeeded in one bottle so far. Mr. Chen has sent someone to fetch it from the warehouse, please wait a moment."
Story-part43_2_7,"Boss Chen, something bad has happened..."
Story-part43_2_8,"As soon as I entered the warehouse, I found a girl drunk on the ground, with a bottle of Formation Breaker wine next to her..."
Story-part43_2_9,"What? Where is that girl, this wine is worth a fortune, we have to make her pay!"
Story-part43_2_10,"That girl is chasing me closely behind, insisting that I am a spy of the Yan army and wants to capture me back to the camp..."
Story-part43_2_11,"Looking at the sword under the lamp in the drunkenness, dreaming back to the horn of the camp... The winery clerk didn't lie to me, although this Formation Breaker is hard to drink, it instantly made me feel heroic!"
Story-part43_2_12,"Hey! You Yan spies, dare to gather together and conspire loudly, don't leave, eat my spear!"
Story-part43_2_13,"This girl is drunk, I have to block her."
Story-part43_3_1,"Just a Wanyan Wuzhu, it's nothing, now you know how powerful I am, right?"
Story-part43_3_2,"This girl is already skilled in martial arts, and now she is drunk, she is even more powerful and unstoppable, it's better to leave first..."
Story-part43_4_1,"Damn Wanyan Wuzhu, if you have the guts, put me down, let's fight for three hundred rounds!"
Story-part43_4_2,"Hmph, even if you Yan people win by fluke, my father and brother will surely avenge me...Vengeful Strike..."
Story-part43_4_3,"Ye Yinping, overwhelmed by alcohol, suddenly closed his eyes and fell asleep.\nYou want to cover him with a blanket and then patiently wait by his side."
Story-part43_4_4,Where... where am I? Why did I fall asleep on the ground...
Story-part43_4_5,"Miss, you were drunk. Would you like some hangover soup?"
Story-part43_4_6,"No need... My head is so confused. I only remember chasing and killing some Yan spies, and then fighting with Wanyan Wuzhu who sneaked into Chuxiang City... I don't know if I won..."
Story-part43_4_7,"Pfft... Let me, Wanyan Wuzhu, tell you, with your tolerance for alcohol, you better not drink next time. It's easy to hurt innocent people."
Story-part43_4_8,"So, I caused trouble... Ah, I didn't hurt you, did I?"
Story-part43_4_9,"To hurt me, the sect leader, you need to practice for a few more years, haha."
Story-part43_4_10,"So you are the {MyFaction}... Oh no! It's already this shichen, I need to hurry back and meet up with my father."
Story-part43_4_11,I am Ye Yinping from the Ye Family Battalion. Thank you for your care today. I will repay you in the future!
Story-part43_5_1,"Sect leader, the wine tasting event in Chuxiang City has ended. You can only participate next year."
Story-part43_5_2,"Such a boring event, it's okay not to go. Just help me decline next time."
Story-part44_1_1,"Sect leader, Miss Ye Yinping from the Ye Family Battalion is here to visit."
Story-part44_1_2,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader... The Ye Family Battalion is gone, and my father and brother are missing..."
Story-part44_1_3,"I don't have many people I can trust now, maybe... only you..."
Story-part44_1_4,"I am also very saddened by the situation of the Ye Family Battalion... Miss Ye, if you have nowhere to go for the time being, why not stay in my sect? With me here, no one dares to trouble you!"
Story-part44_1_5,Thank you... Then I will take up your offer...
Story-part44_1_6,"This is the spear technique that my father passed on to me at the end, please keep it for me, sect leader..."
Story-part45_1_1,"Sect leader, Miss Ye Yinping from the Ye Family Battalion is here to visit."
Story-part45_1_2,"{PlayerSurName} Sect leader, do you still remember me?"
Story-part45_1_3,No one would forget such a spirited Miss Ye.
Story-part45_1_4,"Wow, do I really leave such a deep impression?"
Story-part45_1_5,"Oh yes, I have some good news to tell you. I passed the Ye Family Battalion assessment presided over by my father, and now I can officially venture into the world!"
Story-part45_1_6,"Congratulations, congratulations, but the world is so big, I don't know where Miss Ye plans to go first?"
Story-part45_1_7,"Of course, I came to your sect! After I went back last time, I bragged a lot about you guys to my father. He said that {PlayerSurName} the sect leader is promising, {MyFaction} has a bright future, and it's just right for me to come here for training."
Story-part45_1_8,"My father also passed on this spear technique to me, saying that it can be mutually beneficial with your sect. What do you think, do you want to learn it~"
Story-part45_1_9,"Did Marshal Ye really say that? I'm so flattered, hehe. Anyway, welcome Miss Ye to join our sect!"
Story-part47_1_1,"Sect leader, a proud and handsome young hero has come to our sect, and there is a beautiful girl who is sleeping soundly with him."
Story-part47_1_2,"They must have important matters to seek help from our sect, go and see them quickly."
Story-part47_name,Sibling Love
Story-part47_log,"A young hero visits your sect, apparently for his sister who can't wake up."
Story-part47_2_1,Are you the {PlayerSurName} sect leader?
Story-part47_2_2,"Indeed, I wonder what brings the young hero here in such a hurry."
Story-part47_2_3,"I am Ling Hongxuan, my younger sister Ling Mengdie suffers from a strange disease that makes her fall into a deep sleep from time to time. Over the years, no matter how we sought medical help, it was to no avail."
Story-part47_2_4,"Recently, I heard that your sect not only excels in Medical, but also has a divine doctor like Qu Wangyou. So, I thought of bringing my sister here for treatment."
Story-part47_2_5,"In that case, Miss Qu, could you please diagnose this young lady?"
Story-part47_2_6,Wangyou is happy to help.
Story-part47_2_7,Huff... Huff... Huff...
Story-part47_2_8,"Young Master Ling, does your sister want to sleep all the time, day and night, when she is ill? Even if she can be awakened sometimes, she can't speak or move, can she?"
Story-part47_2_9,"As expected of a divine doctor, you hit the nail on the head!"
Story-part47_2_10,"The ""Ling Shu"" records that ""when the Yang Qi is exhausted and the Yin Qi is abundant, the eyes will close"", ""if the Wei Qi stays in the Yin for a long time, its Qi will not be clear, then it will want to close, so it will sleep a lot""."
Story-part47_2_11,"Sect Leader, this young lady has a very rare disease of excessive sleep. From the perspective of the pathogenesis, it is a manifestation of congenital Yang deficiency and Yin excess."
Story-part47_2_12,"Sleep, for ordinary people, is a way to replenish energy, return Yin and consolidate Yang."
Story-part47_2_13,"But for this young lady, it's the exact opposite. These endless sleeps have severely depleted her vitality. If left unchecked, she will exhaust her life force within two years."
Story-part47_2_14,"Since the pathogenesis has been found, is there a way to treat it?"
Story-part47_2_15,"There is a way, but it requires a medicine called <color=#a94e37> Cultivation Powder </color>, but the medicine lead is hard to find..."
Story-part47_2_16,"This medicine lead is a poisonous insect called Dragon lice, which is said to live in ancient tombs that are hundreds of years old, and is very hard to find."
Story-part47_2_17,"No worries, having a clue is half the battle."
Story-part47_2_18,"This Mortal Sword is my family's Martial Arts, consider it as the consultation fee for Miss Qu's treatment of my sister."
Story-part47_2_19,"I will set off immediately to find the ancient tomb. Please, Sect Leader {PlayerSurName}, take care of my sister. I will repay your kindness in the future!"
Story-part47_3_1,"Sect Leader, that young hero was furious when you kept avoiding him and suddenly left. I heard he went elsewhere to seek medical help for his sister."
Story-part47_3_2,"It was my negligence that upset the siblings, I hope they will come back..."
Story-part48_1_1,"Sect Leader, that young hero Ling has returned to our sect in a hurry, saying he has urgent matters to discuss with you."
Story-part48_1_2,"Young Master Ling, you've been gone for several months, have you found the Dragon lice?"
Story-part48_1_3,"Sect Leader {PlayerSurName}, I'm ashamed to say... I've been inquiring everywhere these days, and finally learned in the north that there is an ancient tomb called Longevity Tomb nearby, where the Dragon lice might be."
Story-part48_1_4,"Unfortunately, this Longevity Tomb is extremely dangerous, full of machinery and poisonous insects. I've tried several times but failed, so I had to come to your sect for help."
Story-part48_1_5,"Don't worry about the machinery and poisonous insects, I'll send a few disciples to accompany you."
Story-part48_name,Longevity Tomb
Story-part48_log,"Ling Hongxuan found out that Dragon lice exist in the Longevity Tomb, so he returned to the sect to ask for your help."
Story-part48_2_1,This is the entrance to the Longevity Tomb.
Story-part48_2_2,"This ancient tomb is very strange, if you are not careful when you first come into contact with it, you will be trapped, so please follow me closely."
Story-part48_2_3,"Young Master Ling, just lead the way, we will follow behind."
Story-part48_2_4,"I've heard of the name Longevity Tomb, it's said to be the place where an ancient immortal ascended to heaven."
Story-part48_2_5,"Look at these murals, they depict this story."
Story-part48_2_6,Hiss...
Story-part48_2_7,"Stop talking about these supernatural things, watch out, poisonous insects are attacking!"
Story-part48_3_1,"Young Master Ling, the poisonous insects here are far more ferocious than those outside, if we don't retreat now, we will surely perish here!"
Story-part48_3_2,"No, if you want to leave, go ahead, my sister really doesn't have time!"
Story-part48_3_3,"You waited at the entrance for three days and three nights, but Ling Hongxuan never returned. \nMeanwhile, Ling Mengdie, who was sleeping in the sect, had her eyes tightly closed, \nbut a few tears inexplicably slid from the corners of her eyes. \nIt seemed as if she was having a dream of life and death. \nThat night, Ling Mengdie quietly passed away in her sleep..."
Story-part48_4_1,"We've dealt with these poisonous insects, let's move on quickly."
Story-part48_4_2,"Strange, why are there so many weird puppets in this tomb room, it's quite creepy..."
Story-part48_4_3,"Young Master Ling, is that thing hiding ahead the Dragon lice your sister needs?"
Story-part48_4_4,"That's it! I've seen it many times, but I've never been able to catch it."
Story-part48_4_5,Click... Click... Click...
Story-part48_4_6,"The puppets in the tomb have been triggered, everyone be careful!"
Story-part48_5_1,"Young Master Ling, these puppets are not something we can handle, if we don't retreat now, we will surely perish here!"
Story-part48_5_2,"No, if you want to leave, go ahead, my sister really doesn't have time!"
Story-part48_5_3,"You waited at the entrance for three days and three nights, but Ling Hongxuan never returned. \nMeanwhile, Ling Mengdie, who was sleeping in the sect, had her eyes tightly closed, \nbut a few tears inexplicably slid from the corners of her eyes. \nIt seemed as if she was having a dream of life and death. \nThat night, Ling Mengdie quietly passed away in her sleep..."
Story-part48_6_1,"Good, the puppets have fallen, Young Master Ling, quickly seize the opportunity to catch the Dragon lice!"
Story-part48_6_2,"You successfully found the Dragon lice and returned safely to the sect. \nQu Wangyou used the processed Dragon lice as a medicine guide, \nmixed with cultivation powder and other auxiliary medicines for Ling Mengdie to take."
Story-part48_6_3,Brother...
Story-part48_6_4,"Mengdie, you're finally awake!"
Story-part48_6_5,"Brother, I've been trapped in a particularly long dream, not only dreaming of you seeking medicine for me, venturing into the ancient tomb, but also dreaming of you having an accident, separated from me by life and death... Mengdie is really scared..."
Story-part48_6_6,"This must be the unique Effective learner of twins, sigh, it's really touching..."
Story-part48_6_7,"Don't worry Mengdie, not only did we return safely, but we also cured your strange disease. Quickly thank {PlayerSurName} sect leader and Doctor Qu!"
Story-part48_6_8,Thank you {PlayerSurName} sect leader... Thank you Doctor Qu...
Story-part48_6_9,"Ling always keeps his word, {PlayerSurName} sect leader, from now on, your sect's affairs are our siblings' affairs, even if we have to go through fire and water, we will not frown!"
Story-part48_7_1,"Sect leader, Young Master Ling saw that you were not helping for a long time, so he quietly took his sister away, and now his whereabouts are unknown."
Story-part48_7_2,"It was my negligence that upset the siblings, I hope they will come back..."
Story-part49_1_1,"Sect leader, a little girl suddenly appeared in the God of Marriage's Shrine in the past few days, although she comes every day, she just sits quietly."
Story-part49_1_2,"Some Pilgrims who came to offer incense thought she was a lost child and went to talk to her. But the little girl wouldn't say anything, just kept her head down and played her flute."
Story-part49_1_3,"This little girl is a bit strange, I'll go check it out later."

Story-part49_log,"A little girl is playing the flute by herself in the God of Marriage's Shrine, not talking to anyone."
Story-part49_2_1,"When you arrive at the God of Marriage's Shrine, it's already dusk.\nThere are few pilgrims at this time, and the sunset is beautiful.\nA little girl is sitting on the railing,\nPlaying a deep and sad flute..."
Story-part49_2_2,"Little girl, why are you sitting here playing the flute so late?"
Story-part49_2_3,……
Story-part49_2_4,"Don't be afraid, I'm not a bad person, I'm just worried about your safety here alone."
Story-part49_2_5,……
Story-part49_2_6,"(It seems that ordinary questions don't work, I have to ask her something she's definitely interested in)"
Story-part49_op_1_1,Are you hungry?
Story-part49_op_1_2,Who did you learn your flute from?
Story-part49_op_1_3,Where did your parents go?
Story-part49_3_1,"Little girl, are you hungry? Would you like something to eat?"
Story-part49_3_2,……
Story-part49_3_3,"It seems she's not interested in this topic, let's ask something else..."
Story-part49_4_1,"Little girl, you play the flute really well. Who did you learn it from?"
Story-part49_4_2,……
Story-part49_4_3,"It seems she's not interested in this topic, let's ask something else..."
Story-part49_5_1,"Little girl, where did your parents go? Leaving you alone here, they must be worried."
Story-part49_5_2,……
Story-part49_5_3,"It seems she's not interested in this topic, let's change it..."
Story-part49_5_4,I came here to find my parents.
Story-part49_5_5,"Little girl, this is the God of Marriage's Shrine, a place where couples and pilgrims come to pray for marriage. Your parents definitely aren't here."
Story-part49_5_6,"Who says they're not here? I heard from the sisters in the village that as long as a man and a woman are married, they have to come to this God of Marriage's Shrine, otherwise they will gradually drift apart and become enemies."
Story-part49_5_7,"Little girl, you're already so grown up, even if your parents had been here before, how could you possibly still be here..."
Story-part49_5_8,But Wei really doesn't know where they are... sob...
Story-part49_5_9,"Wei wants to see her parents, so she sneaked out of the house, even if there's only a slight chance, Wei wants to try..."
Story-part49_5_10,"This melody was taught to me by the abbess, she said as long as I play it, my parents will hear it. But no matter how much I play these past few days, they never respond..."
Story-part49_5_11,(What a pitiful child. This can't go on. How should I persuade her?)
Story-part49_op_2_1,Your parents would be very angry if they knew you were doing this.
Story-part49_op_2_2,The sisters in the village will worry about you if you sneak out.
Story-part49_6_1,Your parents would be very angry if they knew you were doing this.
Story-part49_6_2,What if you run into bad people when you're out and about at such a young age?
Story-part49_6_3,"Wei'er doesn't need you to worry about her, Wei'er is not afraid of bad people!"
Story-part49_6_4,(The child ran off in a puff of smoke. Did I say something wrong...?)
Story-part49_7_1,The sisters in the village will worry about you if you sneak out.
Story-part49_7_2,"Although your parents are not around, you still have those sisters who care about you."
Story-part49_7_3,The sisters in the village?
Story-part49_7_4,"Yes, your parents are your family, but these sisters are also your family."
Story-part49_7_5,"Family should not be mourned when lost, but cherished when they are with us."
Story-part49_7_6,Cherish... each other...
Story-part49_7_7,They must be worried sick about you since you've been out for so long. Let's go back and check on them.
Story-part49_7_8,"Remember to practice martial arts with your sisters when you get back, so you can protect yourself when you're looking for your parents."
Story-part49_7_9,"Thank you for telling Wei'er this... What's your name, big brother?"
Story-part49_7_10,"I am {PlayerName} of {MyFaction}, if you need help in the future, just come to me."
Story-part49_7_11,"Ah, I've heard the sisters in the village talk about you, I know you're all good people."
Story-part49_7_12,"Then Wei'er will go back first, goodbye big brother!"
Story-part49_8_1,"Master, the little girl in the God of Marriage's Shrine has suddenly disappeared. According to the pilgrims, she was taken away by a beautiful woman."
Story-part49_8_2,"That must be her mother, let's not meddle in other people's affairs."
Story-part50_1_1,"Master, Miss Yu Wei'er from the Melody House has come to visit."
Story-part50_1_2,"{PlayerSurName} Master, there is no Melody House anymore..."
Story-part50_1_3,"The sisters in the village took Wei'er and broke through the siege, telling me to go to {MyFaction}, saying that you are someone who can protect Wei'er and this Manual."
Story-part50_1_4,"Afterwards, the nun sister went back to Melody House on her own and stayed there forever, no matter how much Wei tried to stop her..."
Story-part50_1_5,"Ah... Wei, don't be too sad, Me and the brothers and sisters in the sect will always protect you."
Story-part50_1_6,"Thank you, big brother..."
Story-part51_1_1,"Master, Miss Yu Wei'er from the Melody House has come to visit."
Story-part51_1_2,"Long time no see, big brother! After Wei returned to Melody House last time, she has been practicing martial arts as you suggested."
Story-part51_1_3,"The nun sister said that with Wei's current martial arts skills, she can protect herself when she goes out to find her parents, so she agreed to let Wei go out and walk around."
Story-part51_1_4,"Big brother, can you accompany Wei to find her parents?"
Story-part51_1_5,"Of course, Wei, you are tired from the journey, take a good rest first."
Story-part51_1_6,"By the way, the nun sister also said to give you this Manual as a thank you for taking care of Wei last time."
Story-part52_1_1,"Leader, the Maiden House in Lin'an City has been infested with various poisonous insects recently, scaring away the customers."

Story-part52_2_3,"These days, our Maiden House really can't do business, every now and then there are Scorpions, Centipedes crawling in."
Story-part52_2_4,"The most hateful thing is, these creatures are all poisonous. Although no customers have been stung yet, many regulars are already afraid to come!"
Story-part52_2_5,"This is Lin'an, there definitely shouldn't be so many local poisonous insects, where did they come from?"
Story-part52_2_6,Found the person who released the poisonous insects!
Story-part52_2_7,"Hey, so it's you little beast who's trying to harm Me."
Story-part52_2_8,"(It seems that someone outside has found the culprit of the poisonous insect infestation, let's go out and see what's going on.)"
Story-part52_2_9,"It's actually a Jiuli person, obviously a spy who sneaked into the Central Plains!"
Story-part52_2_10,"No... Caidie is not a spy, she's just helping her brother catch poisonous insects..."
Story-part52_2_11,"You little girl are full of lies, if you are here to catch poisonous insects, how could you let them run all over the place?"
Story-part52_2_12,"That's because Caidie is weak and couldn't carry the basket, so the little guys inside ran out..."
Story-part52_2_13,"Uncles and sisters, don't be angry, Caidie has been trying hard to catch them these days."
Story-part52_2_14,Catch? Catch my ass! You're clearly cursing people!
Story-part52_2_15,"Me say don't be charmed by this little girl, the Jiuli Tribe sees us Central Plains people as alien enemies, they can't wait to curse and kill more of us!"
Story-part52_2_16,"Exactly, let's catch this Jiuli demon girl first."
Story-part52_2_17,"You guys are so fierce, why do you keep wronging Caidie?"
Story-part52_2_18,"(It looks like these guys are about to attack the little girl, should I stop them?)"
Story-part52_op_1_1,"She has offended the public, it's not wise to help"
Story-part52_op_1_2,I can't ignore such bullying of the weak
Story-part52_3_1,"(Although she didn't mean to harm people, this incident did indeed start because of her.)"
Story-part52_3_2,"Die, demon girl, ah... she, she cursed Me! Help!"
Story-part52_3_3,"Caidie won't cry, Caidie won't cry!"
Story-part52_3_4,"Brother was right, Central Plains people are not good people!"
Story-part52_4_1,(I can't ignore such bullying of the weak.)
Story-part52_4_2,"Stop! This Jiuli girl is innocent and naive, she definitely doesn't mean to harm people!"
Story-part52_4_3,"Hey, don't think that just because you're from {MyFaction}, you can protect the demon girl."
Story-part52_4_4,"Help! {MyFaction} is colluding with the spy from Jiuli Tribe, Wolf!"
Story-part52_4_5,You're asking for death!
Story-part52_5_1,A tiger bullied by a dog when it falls on the plain... I underestimated my enemy...
Story-part52_5_2,"Die, demon girl, ah... she, she cursed Me! Help!"
Story-part52_5_3,"Caidie won't cry, Caidie won't cry!"
Story-part52_5_4,"Brother was right, Central Plains people are not good people!"
Story-part52_6_1,Do you want to die or leave? I'll only ask once.
Story-part52_6_2,"Hero, we'll leave immediately, far away..."
Story-part52_6_3,"Little girl, don't be afraid. I'm {PlayerName} from {MyFaction}. If anyone bullies you in the future, just mention these two names."
Story-part52_6_4,{MyFaction}……{PlayerName}……
Story-part52_6_5,"Caidie will remember these two names, thank you!"
Story-part52_6_6,"Caidie needs to hurry back. If I don't bring these little ones back in time, my brother will scold me again..."
Story-part52_7_1,"Leader, the poisonous insects of Maiden House have suddenly disappeared. I don't know why they were rampant before."
Story-part52_7_2,"The world is full of wonders, even I, as the leader, can't figure it out."
Story-part53_1_1,"Leader, a young girl named Miao Caidie has come to visit."
Story-part53_1_2,"{PlayerName}, my brother and Caidie's home are gone, sob sob..."
Story-part53_1_3,"Caidie only knows that you {MyFaction} are good people, can you please take Caidie in..."
Story-part53_1_4,"Caidie, I've heard about the Jiuli Tribe. From now on, consider this sect your home. There will be many brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts willing to take care of you and protect you."
Story-part53_1_5,"This is the Manual that my brother gave to Caidie at the last moment, you can keep it."
Story-part54_1_1,"Leader, a young girl named Miao Caidie has come to visit."
Story-part54_1_2,"{PlayerName}, my brother said that Caidie's Gu technique has been perfected, and she needs to run away from Jiuli to find more powerful bugs."
Story-part54_1_3,"My brother also gave Caidie a martial arts Manual that she can't understand, telling her to learn it for self-defense."
Story-part54_1_4,"Caidie is not familiar with the Central Plains, so I want to ask you to let Caidie stay here, is that okay..."
Story-part54_1_5,"Of course, but Caidie is a bug catcher, do you think I look like a big bug haha?"
Story-part54_1_6,"No, not at all!"
Story-part54_1_7,"Eh, why not?"
Story-part54_1_8,Because you're much cuter than a big bug haha!
Story-part55_1_1,"Leader, recently a swordsmith came to our sect to buy Ore, seems like he wants to forge a divine weapon Sharp."
Story-part55_1_2,"Only Langya Sword Pavilion is good at sword forging in the martial arts world, I don't know which disciple it is, send someone to check it out."
Story-part55_name,Refined Steel
Story-part55_log,"A swordsmith from the Sword Pavilion has come to your sect, seems like he wants to find materials to forge a divine weapon."
Story-part55_2_1,"Young man, the divine weapon in this blueprint can't be forged with ordinary metal..."
Story-part55_2_2,"I know, that's why I need to buy Ore from your sect. Once I return to my sect, I will definitely repay you generously."
Story-part55_2_3,"I have a family smelting technique that can repeatedly melt and forge a large amount of pig iron, refining a bit of Refined Steel. Although the loss is huge, it's barely enough for forging materials."
Story-part55_2_4,Refined Steel... Are you a descendant of Ouyezi?
Story-part55_2_5,"Exactly, I am Ouye Heng from Langya Sword Pavilion. To forge this sword, I probably need 3000 Ore, I hope your sect can lend a hand."
Story-part55_2_6,"(This person is quite obsessed with sword forging, should I help?)"
Story-part55_op_1_1,"Sorry, our sect can't help"
Story-part55_op_1_2,"Feel free to use it, if it's not enough, just ask our sect for more (3000 Ore)"
Story-part55_3_1,"Sorry, our own Ore is barely enough, we really can't help."
Story-part55_3_2,"I see... I was presumptuous, please forgive me."
Story-part55_4_1,"Feel free to use, if not enough, you can always ask for more from our sect."
Story-part55_4_2,Thank you for your generous help! The sword should be ready in about half a month.
Story-part55_4_3,"After getting the Ore, Ouye Heng borrowed a Blacksmith's forge and worked day and night. Half a month passed in a blink of an eye. Just as you were about to find Ouye Heng to celebrate, he found you first."
Story-part55_4_4,"My learning is not refined, the difficulty of forging this sword far exceeds the initial expectation. There is no shortcut, only patience and meticulousness, hammering and refining, can make it a weapon."
Story-part55_4_5,"No problem, you just focus on forging, our sect will not interfere too much."
Story-part55_4_6,"When smelting hundred-refined steel, I wasted a lot of ore due to improper control of the heat. I know this request is too much, but please sell another 6000 ores on credit!"
Story-part55_op_2_1,"Sorry, our sect can't help"
Story-part55_op_2_2,"Our sect, like Young Hero Ouye, hopes for the success of this sword (6000 Ore)."
Story-part55_5_1,"Sorry, our own Ore is barely enough, we really can't help."
Story-part55_5_2,"I see... I was presumptuous, please forgive me."
Story-part55_6_1,"Our sect, like Young Hero Ouye, hopes for the success of this sword. It's just some Ore after all, we will send a Disciple to deliver it on horseback."
Story-part55_6_2,"Thank you for your trust, I will definitely forge this sword!"
Story-part55_7_1,"Leader, the swordsmith was in a hurry. Seeing that no one from our sect was attending to him for a long time, he turned around and left."
Story-part55_7_2,"If he's so impatient, he probably can't forge the sword. Let him go."
Story-part56_1_1,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, I have successfully forged the ""Legendary Blade Zhan Lu"" today!"
Story-part56_1_2,The Ore I borrowed from your sect will be returned as soon as I get back to the Sword Pavilion. I won't delay.
Story-part56_1_3,"Young Hero Ouye, I'm afraid you won't be able to return to the Sword Pavilion..."
Story-part56_1_4,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, what do you mean by that?"
Story-part56_1_5,"During the time you were secluded for forging, the Langya Sword Pavilion was unexpectedly involved in the martial arts disputes and has been destroyed by other sects..."
Story-part56_1_6,"No, that's impossible! My master's swordsmanship is divine, and my senior brother is brilliant. How could this happen?"
Story-part56_1_7,"Young Hero Ouye, please restrain your grief. Whether what {PlayerSurName} said is true or not, you can find out by asking around."
Story-part56_1_8,"As soon as you finished speaking, Ouye Heng rushed out of the door. A few shichen later, he appeared before you again, kneeling on both knees, his eyes red, seemingly filled with irreconcilable anger."
Story-part56_1_9,"Ouye Heng requests to join your sect, to avenge the Sword Pavilion. This Legendary Blade Zhan Lu is my gift to the master, please accept me!"
Story-part56_1_10,"Please get up, I agree to your request."
Story-part57_1_1,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, I have successfully forged the ""Legendary Blade Zhan Lu"" today!"
Story-part57_1_2,The Ore I borrowed from your sect will be returned as soon as I get back to the Sword Pavilion. I won't delay.
Story-part57_1_3,"Your master, Senior Jian Chi, sent a letter asking you to stay in our sect for a while."
Story-part57_1_4,"Impossible, let me see the letter from my master!"
Story-part57_1_5,So my master didn't teach me swordsmanship because he was worried that the huge changes in my youth would lead to inner demons and fall into the evil path.
Story-part57_1_6,"The Legendary Blade Zhan Lu is a sword of benevolence. Since I was able to forge it today, it means that my inner demons are gone. All of this is thanks to {MyFaction}, and I must repay this great kindness."
Story-part57_1_7,"{PlayerSurName} Leader, I am willing to stay for a while and forge swords for your sect until I repay my gratitude."
Story-part57_1_8,"This Legendary Blade Zhan Lu is a gift to your sect, consider it as the cost of borrowing the Ore."
Story-part58_1_1,"Leader, it is said that there are often hot waves coming from the Flame Toad Cave, as if there is something extremely hot inside."
Story-part58_1_2,It's probably either a strange beast or a treasure. Send a Disciple to check it out.
Story-part58_name,Strange news about the Flame Toad.
Story-part58_log,"Heat waves often hit you in the face in the Flame Toad Cave, suggesting that something special might be hidden inside."
Story-part58_2_1,"Since our sect took over the surrounding area, this is my first time coming to the Flame Toad Cave."
Story-part58_2_2,"We didn't go far into the cave before a heat wave hit us, now we've gone deep, it's like being roasted on a stove."
Story-part58_2_3,"Don't rush, let's explore slowly. At least we need to find the source of the heat."
Story-part58_2_4,"Eh? There's someone lying over there, let's go check it out."
Story-part58_2_5,"Be careful, there's an animal attacking!"
Story-part58_3_1,"These fire lizards are not only powerful, but also extremely hot. Our martial arts can't handle them, let's retreat to the cave entrance!"
Story-part58_4_1,"No matter how powerful they are, they are just brainless beasts. It's a good idea to take them back to the sect and let Cook make fire lizard skewers."
Story-part58_4_2,The person lying on the ground seems to have moved suddenly...
Story-part58_4_3,"Brother, are you okay? You seem to have open wounds from fire lizard bites all over you..."
Story-part58_4_4,I... I'm fine...
Story-part58_4_5,How can you be fine in such high temperatures? Hiss... half of your face is already...
Story-part58_4_6,"I am He Denuo, thank you both for saving me."
Story-part58_4_7,"Because of the Flame Toad Technique I learned from this cave, not only is my appearance half-ruined, but I also suffer from the pain of fire poison every day."
Story-part58_4_8,"In order to find a cure, I had to enter the Flame Toad Cave again. Unexpectedly, it aggravated the fire poison in my body, causing me to become unconscious due to the fire poison attacking my heart, and I was almost eaten by these beasts."
Story-part58_4_9,"You two saved my life, this Flame Toad Technique has strong side effects, but it's also a superior internal skill, consider it as a thank you."
Story-part58_4_10,"I still need to find a cure for the fire poison, so I'll take my leave."
Story-part58_4_11,"Wait, come to our {MyFaction}, the divine doctor Qu Wangyou is in our sect, she should be able to cure your fire poison."
Story-part58_4_12,"Qu Wangyou of the Herbology Sect? If it's her, then there is hope! I am willing to join your sect!"
Story-part58_5_1,"Sect leader, something happened in the Flame Toad Cave and the fire has suddenly intensified. It's impossible to enter directly now."
Story-part58_5_2,"Ah, we missed the good opportunity to enter. We can only wait for the fire to subside before we go and explore again."
Story-part59_1_1,"Sect leader, there is a snow leopard wandering near our sect. For the safety of the disciples, please capture or drive it away."

Story-part59_2_3,"Whether it's a snow leopard or not, let's catch it first."
Story-part59_2_4,Meow...
Story-part59_2_5,Spare the cat under the knife!
Story-part59_2_6,"Be careful, someone suddenly drew a sword and attacked!"
Story-part59_3_1,"This person's swordsmanship is sharp, it seems that he came just to find this snow leopard. I'd better retreat first..."
Story-part59_4_1,"There's no mistake, this is my Snow Fur..."
Story-part59_4_2,"Snow Fur, I finally see you, I was so worried..."
Story-part59_4_3,Is this your lost snow leopard?
Story-part59_4_4,"Snow leopard? This is clearly a cat, just a bit bigger."
Story-part59_4_5,Meow meow meow~
Story-part59_4_6,"Listen, it can meow, how cute."
Story-part59_4_7,"By the way, my name is Lu Jian Nan, I just ran away from home not long ago. I wonder if your sect could shelter us for a few days. I promise Snow Fur won't cause any trouble."
Story-part59_4_8,"Since you are the young master of the Beast Manor, our sect will naturally welcome you."
Story-part59_5_1,"Sect leader, the snow leopard has suddenly disappeared, I don't know where it went."
Story-part59_5_2,"Let it go wherever it wants, as long as it doesn't harm others."
Story-part60_1_1,"Headmaster, Sect Leader Qu Wangyou has come to visit."
Story-part60_1_2,"It seems that the news of our sect's abundant Herb has reached Sect Leader Qu's ears, please invite her in quickly!"
Story-part60_1_3,Wangyou pays her respects to {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader.
Story-part60_1_4,"Sect Leader Qu, there's no need to be so polite. Although your sect has suffered a disaster, with your Healing Hands skill, there's no worry about rising again."
Story-part60_1_5,"The head of {PlayerSurName} is joking, the Herbology Sect should follow the Heart of Healer's principle and live in seclusion. Since you chose to step into the martial world and seek self-destruction, why repeat the same mistakes?"
Story-part60_1_6,"The Herbology Sect is no more, {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, just call me Wangyou."
Story-part60_1_7,"I came here this time because I encountered several people with strange diseases and unfortunate fates. I don't have enough Herb with me, so I came to ask for your sect's help."
Story-part60_1_8,"We have plenty of Herb, but you can't carry all of them by yourself, Wangyou. Let me accompany you."
Story-part60_1_9,"Thank you very much, {PlayerSurName} Sect Leader!"
Story-part60_1_10,"With your dedicated help, Qu Wangyou used her exquisite Medical skills to cure these patients who made other peers sigh in despair."
Story-part60_1_11,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, I really appreciate your sect's help this time. Without your assistance, these poor people might not have survived."
Story-part60_1_12,"Now that these patients have been cured, I wonder what Wangyou's next plan is?"
Story-part60_1_13,"I plan to continue wandering the martial world, find a secluded valley where few people tread and live in seclusion, read medical books, plant herbs, as long as the medical knowledge of my sect is not lost."
Story-part60_1_14,"Wangyou, if you live in seclusion in a valley, it will be difficult for ordinary patients to find you."
Story-part60_1_15,"Not to mention patients, it would be difficult to find a disciple in such a place. I can't possibly be forced to take a Brilliant monkey as a disciple and train it to be a monkey medical saint, haha!"
Story-part60_1_16,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader makes a good point, I didn't consider that."
Story-part60_1_17,"Wangyou, your Medical skills and medical ethics should not be buried. Join our sect."
Story-part60_1_18,"{PlayerSurName} Sect Leader, were you serious about what you just said..."
Story-part60_1_19,"Although saving the world is not my wish, if it is your ideal, {MyFaction}'s Disciple is willing to be the one to carry the firewood for the fire."
Story-part60_1_20,"My word is my bond, there is no falsehood. I hope Wangyou can trust me."
Story-part60_1_21,"I trust your sect, and I trust you... then please teach me more, headmaster."
Story-part61_1_1,"Headmaster, after the destruction of the Langya Sword Pavilion, Jian Chi has been missing. Today, a Disciple reported that they found his hiding place."
Story-part61_1_2,"If we could get this Peak of Jianghu Sword to join our sect, it would be like adding wings to a tiger. But the question is, how to convince him..."
Story-part61_1_3,"Hmm... As a martial arts fanatic who seeks the way through the sword, perhaps the only way to convince Jian Chi is to defeat him in a duel."
Story-part61_name,Peak of Jianghu Sword
Story-part61_log,"The location of Jian Chi's hideout has been accidentally leaked, which is a great opportunity to recruit this unparalleled swordsman."
Story-part61_2_1,Who dares to disturb my peace!
Story-part61_2_2,"I heard that Senior Jian Chi has secluded himself here, a pearl in the dust. I have come specifically to ask the senior to come out of seclusion."
Story-part61_2_3,"The Sword Pavilion is the fruit of my life's work. Since it has been destroyed, I have no intention of living under others' roofs. You may leave."
Story-part61_2_4,"I would like to make a bet with you. If I lose, I will leave immediately without any further ado; but if I win by chance, I hope you can join our sect."
Story-part61_2_5,"I have no interest in your nonsensical bet. If you don't leave, don't blame me for being ruthless under my sword."
Story-part61_2_6,What if the bet is that I can easily crack the Sword Pavilion's swordsmanship?
Story-part61_2_7,"Hmph, arrogant. If you can easily break my swordsmanship, not to mention joining your sect, even if you ask me to commit suicide by drawing my sword, I won't mind."
Story-part61_2_8,"I don't want a peerless swordsman like you to die, please draw your sword."
Story-part61_3_1,"It seems your talk is far from matching your skills. Leave, and don't let me see you again."
Story-part61_3_2,Our sect has underestimated the strength of the Peak of Jianghu's sword. We have to give up on recruiting...
Story-part61_4_1,I concede!
Story-part61_4_2,I didn't expect {MyFaction}'s Martial Arts to be so profound. I was too narrow-minded...
Story-part61_4_3,"Well, since you have genuinely cracked my swordsmanship, I will keep my promise..."
Story-part61_4_4,"The Sword Pavilion is destroyed, this Heaven Sutra must not be lost, I will give it to your sect."
Story-part61_5_1,"Master, Jian Chi's secluded place is suddenly empty. I wonder if he has discovered our sect's surveillance disciple."
Story-part61_5_2,"I was about to send someone to recruit him, what a pity."
Story-part62_1_1,"Master, the former Beast Manor master Tang Tai Jun suddenly broke into our sect, insisting on taking Tang Wan Er and Lu Jian Nan away."

Story-part62_log,"Tang Tai Jun, worried about the safety of the younger generation, forcefully broke into your sect, trying to forcibly take Lu Jian Nan and Tang Wan Er away."
Story-part62_2_1,"Jian Nan, Wan Er, you two quickly pack up and follow me to run away from here."
Story-part62_2_2,"Mother, why did you suddenly come and suddenly want to take us away?"
Story-part62_2_3,"Aunt, we have already joined {MyFaction}. If we leave without notifying {PlayerSurName}'s master, it would be against our principles..."
Story-part62_2_4,"The martial world is dangerous, the Beast Manor no longer exists. If you stay here, you are in the whirlpool, risking your lives."
Story-part62_2_5,"Listen to me, don't force me to take you away from the martial world."
Story-part62_2_6,"Master Tang, children will eventually grow up. I think it would be better for you to have a good talk with them."
Story-part62_2_7,"Hmph, when I was young and dominating the southwest, you didn't even know where you were."
Story-part62_2_8,You are not qualified to interfere in our Beast Manor's affairs!
Story-part62_3_1,"I didn't expect Tang Tai Jun to be so old, but his martial arts hasn't regressed at all... I can only use the Human Wave Tactic..."
Story-part62_3_2,"{MyFaction} Disciples, quickly form a formation and surround them, be careful not to hurt Master Tang!"
Story-part62_3_3,"You losers who only know how to bully the weak, I will come back to teach you a lesson next time!"
Story-part62_4_1,"Indeed, there are always new talents emerging..."
Story-part62_4_2,"Aunt, we are really not children anymore. The decision to join {MyFaction} was made after careful consideration by my cousin and me."
Story-part62_4_3,"Mother, you told me to travel outside before, saying that I should find what I want to do and become a successful man."
Story-part62_4_4,"What I want to do most now is to stay in {MyFaction}, just like my mother did back then, to contribute to the country and the people. You can't force me to stay!"
Story-part62_4_5,"Ah, it's rare for you to have such ambition, Jian Nan..."
Story-part62_4_6,"But I'm really worried about you and Wan'er, I don't want you to experience the downfall of Beast Manor again..."
Story-part62_4_7,"Since Master Tang is so concerned about the two children, why not join our sect as well? You can watch the children grow up and take care of them when they are in danger."
Story-part62_4_8,"Yes, mother, you should join {MyFaction} too. If you are living in seclusion alone, I will worry about you."
Story-part62_4_9,This child... sigh... then I will impose on your sect...
Story-part62_5_1,"Leader, Tang Tai Jun tried to forcibly take away our sect's disciple, but was outnumbered and forced to flee."
Story-part62_5_2,"Since the person wasn't taken away, let's just pretend this never happened."
Story-part63_1_1,"Leader, since the fall of Confucius Temple, the former Dojokeeper Cai Yuanchang has disappeared."
Story-part63_1_2,"Today, a disciple sent a message saying that someone saw him enter the Longevity Tomb alone five days ago and he hasn't come out yet."
Story-part63_1_3,"I don't know if this Confucian master has died in the tomb, it's really lamentable, send someone to check it out."

Story-part63_2_3,"Dojokeeper Cai, can you hear me? Dojokeeper Cai?"
Story-part63_2_4,"(He seems to have fallen into a state of closed-eye meditation, let's observe the surroundings first.)"
Story-part63_2_5,"(In front of Cai Yuanchang is a copper cauldron with dried blood, and next to it is an ancient stone tablet, what should I do?)"
Story-part63_op_1_1,"This place is eerily strange, let's retreat quickly."
Story-part63_op_1_2,Drop blood into the copper cauldron and observe the changes
Story-part63_3_1,"This place is eerily strange, don't touch anything randomly, retreat first."
Story-part63_4_1,"(After dropping blood into the copper cauldron, two rows of inscriptions appear on the stone tablet)"
Story-part63_4_2,"The first row is ""Three teachings unite, Confucianism rules the world, the Cai family rules the royal family""..."
Story-part63_4_3,"The second row is ""The immortal Longevity fruit, a dream of Huang Liang ends in emptiness""..."
Story-part63_4_4,"These inscriptions are disjointed, and I don't know what they mean. Upon reflection, they seem like a kind of prophecy."
Story-part63_4_5,"The prophecy says that the curator is the master of destiny, now give me your life to help me achieve the Longevity path!"
Story-part63_5_1,"The prophecy never lies. I, Cai Yuanchang, am the chosen one by destiny!!!"
Story-part63_5_2,"He has fallen into madness, if this continues, I will lose more than I gain, retreat first."
Story-part63_6_1,"The prophecy never lies. I, Cai Yuanchang, am the chosen one by destiny!!!"
Story-part63_6_2,"Uh, ah!!!!!!"
Story-part63_6_3,"Dojokeeper Cai, you have suffered a backlash and your skills have greatly diminished, do you still want to take my life?"
Story-part63_6_4,"As long as you swear not to reveal what you saw today, I will pass on the treasure of Confucius Temple to you, and I will not pursue it afterwards..."
Story-part63_6_5,"Dojokeeper Cai, I can swear not to let a third party know, but there is one more condition."
Story-part63_6_6,What condition? Join your {MyFaction}?
Story-part63_6_7,Indeed!
Story-part63_6_8,"Humph, a tiger falling on a flat ground is bullied by a dog, I will follow you."
Story-part63_7_1,"Leader, the Longevity Tomb collapsed for unknown reasons, completely sealing the entrance."
Story-part63_7_2,I didn't expect Grand Master Cai Yuanchang to be buried here in the end...
Story-part64_1_1,"Headmaster, Master Hui Yuan suddenly came to Daliang City for some reason, claiming to publicly auction the treasure of Shifa Temple, the ""Vairocana Solar Sutra""."
Story-part64_1_2,"Although Shifa Temple has been destroyed, why would the master want to sell this precious internal strength book to the secular people? Send someone to check it out quickly."

Story-part64_2_2,"My son is in need of a profound internal strength book, if we miss this opportunity, we will regret it for a lifetime!"
Story-part64_2_3,"There are so many people at the auction, I wonder how high this priceless divine skill will be bid up to."
Story-part64_2_4,Amitabha...
Story-part64_2_5,"Today, I visited this precious place and found that there is a flood disaster nearby. Countless people are homeless, eating tree bark and mud, barely clothed and hungry."
Story-part64_2_6,"I have visited many wealthy merchants in an attempt to raise funds and pray for the disaster-stricken people, but unfortunately, they are indifferent and ignorant of the Dharma."
Story-part64_2_7,"I have nothing to my name, but I can't bear to see the people suffer. I have no choice but to auction this Scripture to exchange for some food to help the people through this difficult time."
Story-part64_2_8,"The master is compassionate, willing to give up such a precious scripture for the people. Without this item, won't the inheritance of Shifa Temple be interrupted?"
Story-part64_2_9,"Although this scripture is precious, it is just a material object. The Shifa Temple in the secular world can be destroyed, but the Shifa Temple in the heart cannot."
Story-part64_2_10,"(Master Hui Yuan probably wants to exchange this scripture for a large amount of food, should I agree?)"
Story-part64_op_1_1,"The Scripture is good, but it's too expensive"
Story-part64_op_1_2,This Scripture is needed by our sect! (10000 food)
Story-part64_3_1,"The Scripture is good, but it's too expensive. Besides, our sect does not lack this kind of top-level internal strength, let's leave it to others."
Story-part64_4_1,This Scripture is needed by our sect!
Story-part64_4_2,"Passing on the light to all, until all lights are bright... You are truly a person with Buddha-nature!"
Story-part64_4_3,"Now that we have enough food, there is another urgent matter. After the flood, diseases are spreading everywhere. If there is no Herb to cure the plague, the people will not be able to live in peace."
Story-part64_4_4,"Since you care about the people, can I use my old body to exchange for some Herbs from your sect?"
Story-part64_4_5,Does the master mean to join our sect as a guest?
Story-part64_4_6,"Exactly, human life is of utmost importance, please make a decision quickly."
Story-part64_4_7,(Should I exchange a large amount of herbs for Master Hui Yuan's joining?)
Story-part64_op_2_1,"Forget it, our sect doesn't have much Herb"
Story-part64_op_2_2,"Having the master join us, even if it empties our stock, is a joy (10000 Herb)"
Story-part64_5_1,"I appreciate the master's kindness, but our sect doesn't have much Herb, it's hard to help."
Story-part64_6_1,"Having the master join us, even if it empties our stock, is a joy!"
Story-part64_6_2,"Amitabha, your sect has saved countless people with this act, truly a great virtue of inseparability and Buddha-nature."
Story-part64_7_1,"Headmaster, I heard that Master Hui Yuan exchanged the ""Vairocana Solar Sutra"" for a large amount of food and herbs, helping the local people avoid the suffering of floods, and then floated away."

Story-part65_6_2,"The old Taoist always thought that he could dominate the world, but he didn't expect to see the {PlayerSurName} sect leader today, and he knew that there are people outside the world, and there are days outside the sky..."
Story-part65_6_3,"The fist is afraid of the young, Zhong Yangzi Spiritual Master, don't be humble. Since you and I have the same aspirations and are willing to Destroy Yan Empire and protect the country and the people, why not join my sect."
Story-part65_6_4,"At this time, the matter is of great importance, and the old Taoist must think carefully..."
Story-part65_6_5,"Alas... If it weren't for the help of the young hero {PlayerSurName} sect leader, the old Taoist would have gone to see the Supreme Master today."
Story-part65_6_6,"The old Taoist is willing to join your sect, and let the {PlayerSurName} sect leader drive without complaint! This Infinity Origin Move is a thank you gift for joining your sect."

Story-part68_4_4,"I've spent a lifetime looking for this Divine Ox Treasury, as long as you're willing to give up the treasure, I'm willing to agree to anything."
Story-part68_4_5,Even joining our sect?
Story-part68_4_6,"As long as you give up the treasure, I, the leader, am not only willing to join your sect, but also willing to teach you the unique Holy Fire Divine Skill. Think about it."
Story-part68_op_1_1,Take the treasure
Story-part68_op_1_2,Give up the treasure
Story-part68_5_1,"Sorry, our sect must have this treasure. Besides, if I kill you, I can also get the Holy Fire Divine Skill."
Story-part68_5_2,You forced me... This day next year will be your death anniversary!
Story-part68_5_3,"(It seems that to get the treasure, I have to deal with Fang Xiaoian, the mighty ruler of the Western Regions, who is going to die here today.)"
Story-part68_5_4,"(Goodbye, Leader Fang, our sect will make good use of your divine skill and treasure.)"
Story-part68_6_1,"The Divine Ox Treasury, no matter how valuable, is not as valuable as your skills, Leader Fang. I'll give you the treasure, I hope you keep your word."
Story-part68_6_2,"Our sect... of course I will keep my word, lead the way."
Story-part68_7_1,"Leader, we were a step too late, the Divine Ox Treasury has already been taken by someone else."
Story-part68_7_2,"If it's not meant to be, don't force it, it's just some worldly possessions."
Story-part69_1_1,"Headmaster, there is a secret place called Waterfall Pond within our sect, although it can help disciples break through martial arts bottlenecks, there is also a risk of obsession."
Story-part69_1_2,"In recent days, there has been a shadow practicing in the pool, but when our disciples approached for information, they found nothing."
Story-part69_1_3,"There are such strange things, I, the leader, will send someone to check it out."
Story-part69_name,Waterfall Pond
Story-part69_log,"Recently, a Mysterious Man has intruded into a secret realm of your sect, and DiscipleInfo has found nothing."
Story-part69_2_1,"I've been to this Waterfall Pond several times, and I've never seen anything special."
Story-part69_2_2,"Wait? I see a shadow meditating under the waterfall, it's... it's Huo Shilou!"
Story-part69_2_3,"Sweeping like a swift wind, cutting leaves, all in one breath, cutting soul's will..."
Story-part69_2_4,"Shifting stars to protect the rear, dense clouds raining to break the encirclement..."
Story-part69_2_5,"Body moving with strength like a strong bow, splitting the heavens and the earth... cough cough... splitting the heavens and the earth... slaughtering the world!"
Story-part69_2_6,"(Damn, Huo Shilou is practicing here and has become Obsessed, should I help him?)"
Story-part69_op_1_1,Quickly retreat
Story-part69_op_1_2,Help
Story-part69_3_1,"Huo Shilou's martial arts are already superb, and after becoming Obsessed, no one can stop him, let him be..."
Story-part69_4_1,"If I don't help, he will surely exhaust his spirit and die here."
Story-part69_4_2,"You rabble of the Divine Flame Sect, come and give your lives to Huo!"
Story-part69_4_3,"He's Obsessed and sees me as a member of the Divine Flame Sect, I need to find a way to wake him up!"
Story-part69_5_1,"Huo Shilou's power has surged after becoming Obsessed, I can't keep up with him, I need to retreat..."
Story-part69_6_1,"Master Huo, are you sober now?"
Story-part69_6_2,Was it you who saved me...
Story-part69_6_3,"I'm ashamed to say, I've been practicing here every night to understand a key point in my blade technique. I suddenly became Obsessed, luckily you woke me up in time..."
Story-part69_6_4,"This place is my {MyFaction} territory, the leader of the Huo family came here to practice, naturally can't escape the eyes of our sect."
Story-part69_6_5,"Although there were some disputes between you and me in the past, I owe a great favor to your sect."
Story-part69_6_6,"The Cold Skin Gang is gone, and I have nowhere to go. If your sect needs me, I won't refuse."
Story-part69_6_7,This Heaven Cutting Blade Technique is my Nomination Certificate to your sect.
Story-part69_7_1,"Leader, the disciple has found out that the shadow at Waterfall Pond is none other than the former Cold Skin Gang Master, Huo Shilou. However, he was obsessed with his training and has died on the spot."
Story-part69_7_2,"Who would have thought that Master Huo, a hero of his time, would meet his end in a small ditch, it's really poignant."
Story-part46_1_1,"Master, a large group of Horse Bandits suddenly appeared near Jade Gate, often robbing and killing nearby merchant caravans. The Disciples have found the bandit's lair, please make a decision quickly."
Story-part46_1_2,"The act of harming merchants cannot be tolerated, send disciples on horseback to eradicate them."
Story-part46_name,Stop Killing by Carrying Coffin
Story-part46_log,"Horse Bandits appeared near Jade Gate and are killing merchant caravans, you are preparing to send people to eradicate them."
Story-part46_2_1,"You sneak into the Horse Bandit camp under the cover of night\nPreparing for a beheading operation to capture the king\nBut the unusual scene in front of the Righteous Hall makes you decide to hold your troops"
Story-part46_2_2,"Where did you come from, bird Taoist priest, carrying such a big coffin, are you here to send me off?"
Story-part46_2_3,"No, I came here to persuade you not to commit murder and infringe on merchants."
Story-part46_2_4,"I heard that you were all good people in your camp. But due to the corruption of the government, they forcibly collected your winter grains and oils under various names, forcing you to rebel."
Story-part46_2_5,"Even so, what wrong did the merchants do? Instead of seeking revenge on the strong, you turn your blades on the weak. This is neither benevolent nor righteous."
Story-part46_2_6,"Heaven values life, as long as you abandon your knife and stop killing, the grain stored in the camp is enough to support you until you harvest from the Wasteland."
Story-part46_2_7,"If you're here to persuade me to be good, why did you bring this coffin as a prop?"
Story-part46_2_8,"This coffin represents my determination. If you do not heed my advice, there will be a battle between me and your stronghold."
Story-part46_2_9,"No matter who lives or dies, they can lie peacefully in this coffin, without the tragic scene of being exposed in the wilderness."
Story-part46_2_10,"Are you teasing me? Brothers, take him down for me!"
Story-part46_2_11,"Don't panic, Taoist priest, I'll help you!"
Story-part46_3_1,"These horse bandits are bloodthirsty and skilled in martial arts, you should retreat back to your sect..."
Story-part46_4_1,"The winner is king, the loser is the enemy. You start, bull nose."
Story-part46_4_2,"Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, I do not wish to kill. Moreover, I know that you were forced into this path."
Story-part46_4_3,"Taoist priest, we are all rough men from the mountains. If that dog official pushes us, we would never resort to this business of holding the mountain for self-protection."
Story-part46_4_4,"At the beginning of this business, we were all trembling, only for money, not killing. But as time went on, everyone gradually forgot their original intention, became profit-oriented, and even many children liked the feeling of licking blood from the knife edge and oppressing the innocent..."
Story-part46_4_5,"As the Taoist priest said, we don't have the courage to take revenge on the real culprit, but vent our anger on the innocent merchants. Comparing our hearts, what's the difference between us and that dog official..."
Story-part46_4_6,"Today, thanks to your reminder, I realized that I have committed many killings. In the final analysis, it's my fault for not disciplining strictly. I am willing to disband the mountain stronghold, commit suicide to apologize, and ask the Taoist priest to give those children a chance to atone..."
Story-part46_4_7,"After the Horse Bandit Leader issued the order to disband the stronghold, he suddenly drew his knife and committed suicide,\nChang Chunzi sighed and helped the other's body to be buried in the coffin\nThe coffin he brought finally came in handy..."
Story-part46_4_8,"Taoist priest Chang Chunzi, please stay."
Story-part46_4_9,"You all came to suppress the bandits, hiding in the dark early, but did not prevent me from reforming the Horse Bandit, for this kindness, I thank you."
Story-part46_4_10,"Taoist priest Chang Chunzi has such a chivalrous and compassionate heart, why not join our sect and fight for the order of the rivers and lakes together, how about?"
Story-part46_4_11,"Well, since your sect agrees with my wish, it's not impossible to go for a walk."
Story-part46_4_12,This sword manual can be considered as a little gift from me.
Story-part46_5_1,"Leader, those Horse Bandits suddenly washed their hands in the golden basin and reformed for some reason."
Story-part46_5_2,Is there such a good thing? Why do I feel that things are not so simple...
